<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>


<p>


    These notes are for general guidance only, individual commissions sometimes require specific agreements.
    If you have any questions not answered below please just get in touch.
</p>


<br />

<h3>Minimum spend </h3>

<p>
    I now take only 12 wedding dress orders per year and each must have a minimum budget of £1600,
    but this can be divided between labour, fabrics, embellishment and accessories to suit.
</p>

<p> I do also still take order for bridesmaids and attendants, mother of bride or groom and other special
    occasion wear for which lower minimum budgets apply. Please see the 'bespoke ordering page' for
    guidance on typical prices for these sorts of orders.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h3> Payments </h3>

<p>
    <img src="{{ site.baseimageref }}graphics/chequebook.jpg" align="left" />
    I accept payment by cheque, by
    direct bank transfer or in cash (by arrangement). You will be invoiced in writing for all monies owing.
    <br />
    <br />

    Orders over £300 can be paid in instalments. Full payment must have
    been received (and cleared) before finished items can be collected
    or delivered.

    <br />
    <br />

    <b>Deposits</b>
    <br />
    Your ‘sewing time’ is not booked until a deposit has been paid. The
    deposit will be the full cost of any materials you are ordering
    through me and/or 20%-50% of the estimated making cost. This is non-refundable.
</p>
<p>Supplying you a quote does not guarantee you a sewing slot, ONLY the paying of deposit books your time.</p>
<p>However If I am getting very booked up and you don't want to loose your possible making slot while you consider your
    options you may pay a 'holding deposit' of £75 which will reserve a slot for you for a period of 1 month.
    The £75 would be deducted from your bill if you decide to book any order with me but is non-refundable if you decide to go elsewhere.
    You would be notified when the deadline for deciding was approaching and given first refusal on that slot even after
    the one month expires unless you have positively contacted me to say you definitely no longer require my services</p>
<br />
<br />



<h3>Cancellations and refunds</h3>
<p>
    <b>Appointment cancellations:</b>
    <br />
    Please let me know ASAP if you need to change or cancel an
    appointment: by telephone NOT e-mail. I know that no one can plan
    for traffic jams, cancelled trains or children falling ill and I
    will try to be reasonable in all cases. Missed appointments and
    cancellations with less than 2 hours notice will be charged for at
    my hourly rate of £25.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Order cancellations:</b>
    <br />
    As every commission is made to order I do have a ‘no returns’
    policy. However, I try to be reasonable and fair about any
    cancellations.
    <br />
    <br />
    Once contacted to advise me of a cancellation I can immediately
    stop
    work if requested and then only charge you for the work
    already
    carried out. Any refund to you or further payments
    requested from you
    would depend on the time at which the
    cancellation is made. If the
    deposit and instalments received are
    not sufficient to cover the work
    by then completed you will be
    invoiced for the balance. Any materials
    and/or partly made items in
    my possession will be forfeit if payment
    is not made.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Materials and partly made items:</b>
    <br />
    If you have ordered fabric through me and cancel before I have
    begun
    cutting into it you will be able to collect or arrange for
    delivery
    of your fabric at your own cost. I will not buy the fabric
    back from
    you but you may choose to leave it with me if you wish.
    If you would
    like to collect any partly-made items or partly-used
    materials this
    can be arranged once any money owing for
    work/materials has been
    received.
</p>
<br />

<h3>Fabrics required and supplied:</h3>
<p>I take no responsibility for the fabric quantity
    guides supplied in quote letters,
    they are only rough estimates.
    <br />
    <br /> In the unlikely
    circumstance that I
    run out of fabric any extra needed will have
    to be paid for by the
    client. I usually over estimate as too much
    is always better than
    too little! I will always keep any large
    fabric scraps or pieces to
    return to you, small pieces are
    usually disposed of unless you
    specifically request otherwise.
</p>
<br />
<br />

<br />
<h3>Weight change and Alterations </h3>
<p> Small size alterations are to be expected during any making process and
    I usually leave at least 2 inches of seam allowance inside the
    garment to allow for changes. The hem will similarly be cut long
    to allow for shoe heels. I can take no responsibility for a
    garment fitting if you loose or gain a lot of weight though I will always do my very best. If you plan
    to diet please inform me early on and we will plan the making
    process accordingly.</p>
<p> If you loose or gain more then 2 inches, which is a whole dress size, I may, at my discretion
    charge extra for any alterations required. In such circumstances I cannot guarantee the dress will be as perfect
    as if made to fit your original measurements, though I have been known work miracles.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h3>Timescales and Rush Orders </h3>
<p>
    <img src="{{ site.baseimageref }}graphics/calendar.jpg" align="right" />
    Most wedding dresses take between one and four weeks of sewing to complete
    (or 40-160 hours), but circumstances rarely allow me to sew one
    dress, from start to finish, with no interruptions. Your wedding
    dress may be cut out, sewn and finished all in a few weeks or
    spread
    out over several months. This will depend on fitting your
    commission
    around my other bookings, the amount of work involved
    and your
    availability for fittings.
    <br />
    <br />
    Orders for bridesmaid’s dresses, children’s or men’s garments are
    usually much quicker to complete but plenty of notice is still
    necessary to ensure there is time available in my schedule.
    <br />
    <br />
    Requests for specific timescales will be accommodated if at all
    possible.
    <br />
    <br />
    The final pick up date can be pencilled in when your commission is
    first booked or we can book each fitting and appointment in turn. Obviously the deadline of your wedding date will be
    strictly
    adhered to.
    <br />
    <br />
    If you book in your order early enough I may
    <i>sometimes</i>
    suggest we make up your order many months in advance. There can
    still be a final fitting in the few weeks before the actual wedding
    to allow for any last minute weight loss/gain. This enables me to
    make up commissions for the summer months during the less busy
    winter period. This should also help your peace of mind, knowing
    your dress is well on its way to completion with lots of time to
    spare.
</p>


<br />

<p>
    <b>Rush orders:</b>
    <br />
    I can sometimes take on rush orders if there is a space in my
    schedule. I will not charge extra for a rush order unless there are
    extra costs to me; for example in the express delivery of materials
    or having to work ‘unsociable hours’. I will never jeopardise a
    confirmed booking by taking on a rush order that will put other
    commissions at risk.
    <br />
    <br />
    If you live overseas or will need to come a long way for fittings
    for any other reason I can sometimes make a dress from initial
    consultation to completion inside one to three weeks, while you
    holiday nearby. You will need to be available for fittings
    throughout your holiday and I will spend all my working hours on
    your commission during that time.
</p>


<br />
<br />
<h3>Outside Appointments</h3>

<p>
    <img src="{{ site.baseimageref }}graphics/doorknocker.jpg" align="right" />

    <b>Long distance orders</b>
    <br />
    If visiting me at my home for consultations or fittings is
    difficult
    ‘outside appointments’ can be arranged at your home or
    another
    convenient place. These will always be charged for at £25
    per hour
    for my time plus travelling expenses.
    <br />
    <br />
    An alternative is the
    <i>‘holiday commission’</i>
    . With planning I can sometimes make a dress from initial
    consultation to completion inside one to three weeks, while you
    holiday nearby. You will need to be available for fittings at pre-arranged times
    throughout your holiday and I will spend all my working hours on
    your commission during that time.

</p>

<p>

    <b>Fabric shopping</b>
    <br />
    I can accompany you on fabric shopping trips, to areas of your own
    choice or to shops I know myself. You may also commission me to
    find
    fabric for you without your attendance. This will be charged
    at £25
    per hour, plus travelling expenses.
</p>
