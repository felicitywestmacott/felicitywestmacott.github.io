        <p>
            I was absolutely delighted with my beautiful dress! I really appreciated the time you took to explain the
            different options and the effort you went to in order to make sure it looked perfect, including an extremely
            useful set of instructions for my bridesmaid on how to make the dress look its best on the day. Your patience,
            enthusiasm and skill made the whole process a pleasure!

            Thank you so much for  all the work you put into getting the dress just right for Ailsa and the helpful
            advice with accessories etc. She looked lovely on the day and felt very comfortable and happy with the dress.
            The dress fittings became a firm part of the wedding preparations and thank you for your welcome when we visited.
            Ian was especially pleased that he could join us for the final fitting.
            With best wishes, Christine

        <h3>Wedding dress for Alison Cowell</h3>
        <p>
            There is only one word to describe my wedding
            dress and that is : perfect! I am so grateful I had you to make my
            dress.
        </p>
        <p>
            The wonderful thing about having your dress designed for you,
            is that it can be exactly what you want and will be unique to who
            you are!
        </p>
        <p>
            I was absolutely overwhelmed with the thought, time and
            attention-to-detail that Felicity devoted to making it! When you
            think how personal your special day is, what could be more
            wonderful than to have your dress personalised as well. Felicity's
            work is exceptional!
        </p>
        <p>
            ...Just a note to say a huge thank you! I truly love my wedding
            dress, you are very talented and I promise to send you a photo!
            <br />
            Wishing you all the best, Alison

        <h3>Wedding dress for Katie Darvall</h3>
        <p>
            I want to thank Felicity for making me the most wonderful wedding dress! I
            tried on quite a few ready made ones and had an idea of what I wanted but
            nothing was quite right. It was very easy taking my ideas to Felicity who
            designed and then made the perfect dress for my special day.  I was able to
            incorporate my colour scheme (Aqua) and theme (Butterflies) by having the
            dress made specifically for me and of course it also meant that it fitted
            beautifully. The cost worked out at no more than buying a shop bought one
            too!
        </p>
        <p>
            I had so many compliments on the day itself and am still getting them now
            when people see the photos- I would highly recommend using Felicity's
            services to anyone who is getting married.... Many thanks, Katie.

            I have already recommended you to one friend and would have no hesitation in doing so again should anyone be in need of the service you provide. You also inspired me to get sewing again and I am currently making myself a skirt and some curtains!!!

            The wedding was amazing. Ellie looked stunning, her dress was so beautiful,

            At such a special time as your wedding you
            want professional people who you can trust and get along with to
            be involved in the crucial big day elements such as bridesmaid
            dresses, and Felicity was just that.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dresses exceeded our expectations in terms of quality of
            the workmanship and they were ready ahead of schedule; if you are
            planning your own wedding, 'ahead of schedule' is a phrase you'll
            come to delight in! Felicity was very easy to work with, she always
            gave good advice whilst having the creative and technical
            understanding to help create the final product. My bridesmaids were
            very comfortable and happy in their dresses and I was so pleased
            with them too, they looked beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had such a special wedding day, helped by people such as
            Felicity. I have already recommended her to friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dear Felicity, very
            many thanks for producing such beautiful dresses, the girls are
            really thrilled with them. We will send you some photos after the
            wedding with them all looking glamorous I'm sure. Mind you I
            mustn't forget the ties.

            The bridesmaids dresses were absolutely
            beautiful gaining so many lovely comments on the day. Your
            perfectionism and attention to detail is evident in the quality of
            you work, through the style and cut, ensuring beautiful, original
            and unique dresses. Moreover your knowledge skill and experience
            in advising on the material, shade and design ensured everything
            came together perfectly whilst maintaining an individuality and
            uniqueness that is second to none. This was also recognised
            through the numerous compliments I received from family and
            friends.
        </p>
        <p>The alterations you made to my wedding dress meant I felt
            perfect. My beautiful handmade tiara by you also received many,
            many compliments. Not least from my darling bridegroom who had a
            tear in his eye on my arrival at the altar – what more can I say!
        </p>
        <p>I would also like to thank you so very much for assisting me
            with the bridesmaids and getting me dressed. Your calmness and
            organisation significantly reduced my anxiety as it was very
            chaotic in the room that morning with so many. Without your help I
            can't imagine how I would have coped.
        </p>
        <p>Fliss, your perfectionism and skill is a real credit to you
            and your profession and I would highly recommend you to any

            emphasis on the gorgeous dress you made me and which drew so many
            appreciative comments from freinds and family.
        </p>
        <p>I would like to say again how very much I enjoyed the process
            of designing a dress with you - from choosing a fabric to
            discussing design and getting fitted, it was a joy to watch it all
            come together.
        </p>
        <p>I hope these photos and comments are of use to you on future
            projects, but please let me know if you need any further reference,
            as I would be happy to supply one.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kind regards
        </p>

        <h3>Wedding dress for Hannah Loney</h3>
        <p>
            Just to say thanks again
            for making my beautiful dress - it's just prefect and I really
            love it! I cant wait to show it to everybody!!!
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks again! Will be sure to recommend you too...
        </p>
        <p>
            Just thought I'd send you a few pics
            of our big day. The dress was perfect and Dan absolutely loved it!
            And it travelled amazingly well considering it took us a car,
            plane, coach and boat to get to the venue!  And wore it again for
            our party back in the UK so it did well!
        </p>
        <p>
            We had a great time so thank you again.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the best!
