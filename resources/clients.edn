A simple silk dupion sash highlighted her tiny waist and the back fastened with buttons and loops. The full skirt was three layers of silk organza over linings and netting flowing out behind in a wide train. <br/> <br/> \n Similar styles from £1850, with silk materials as shown £2700 <br/> <br/> \n I also made Issie's very two tier long veil. The train part was trimmed in matching lace edging to her dress and the blusher (comes over her face) was edged with simple cording. As shown £175"

The lace extends higher to just below the collar-bone with narrow straps set wide on the shoulders. The back of the dress plunges in a deep v-neck of shear lace. The pretty scalloped edge from the lace will has been used to edge and soften the neckline at front and all down the back. The underbust line is emphasised with a band of exquisite diamante trim, finished by hand at the sides and back to fade away to nothing. The dress was very fitted to the waist and hips before flaring very gently to the floor. The satin under-layer had only a puddle train while the lace will extended longer so there was a wide band of shear lace beyond the satin. The lace hem was also all edged with the same pretty scalloped edging as the neckline.\n\n</p>",

    "\n <br />\n <br />\nAlison commissioned a soft floaty gown in silk satin and tulle.\n <br />\nThe dress was cut with simple princess seams and a fitted, lightly boned bodice with invisible zip back closure. \nThe dress was made from many layers, two layers of soft ivory silk-tulle, soft ivory satin, an interlining for strength \nand then lined with the same silk satin for a really luxurious finish. All the layers extended to the floor and at the back \ninto a foamy, medium length train.\n<br /> \n<br /> \nA layer of tulle was gathered over the bust to create texture and define Alison's slenderest point, the under bust line. \nThe ruffled tulle extended up past the top of the main dress to create a soft open neckline, off the shoulder and fastening \nwith a single covered button at the back. Long fitted sleeves were made of the same soft tulle. The sleeves were also slightly\n ruched and ended with a soft bell shaped opening.\n <br />\n <br />\n<b>\nSimilar styles from £1200\n</b>\n <br />\n<i>\nWith all silk fabrics and detailing as shown £2300\n\n <br />\nThe fabrics Alison chose were particularly luxurious and therefore expensive. The silk tulle was £70 per metre! Savings \ncould be made by using cotton tulle (£44) or polyester tulle (£4.50) instead.\n</i>",

    "<b>\nWedding dress and fascinator for Faye Martinez\n</b>\n<br />\n<i>\nOfficial Wedding pictures by <a href=\"http://www.allanbreezephotographer.co.uk/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Allan Breeze</a>\n</i>\n<br />\n <br />\nFaye commissioned an unusual dress in black and red duchess satin. The inspiration for the design came from a dress worn by a \nlady in one of her favourite music videos! Faye's dress was created as a two piece, bodice and skirt but with several\n different ways the skirt and train could be worn to give different looks for the ceremony and into the evening. \n <br />\n <br />\nFaye's dress has a fitted and heavily boned bodice with a sweetheart neckline edged with pleated black tulle and \nbeaded lace to soften the line. It laced shut at the back over a contrast colour modesty panel.\nThe skirt was fitted to her upper hip and then flared in an a-line over netting to the floor. A feature water-fall 'pick-up'\nwas pinned up to her bodice with a beautiful brooch, connecting the two halves of the design, and revealing the contrast red \nunderskirt. The red hip sash was finished with long sash ends at the back that flowed down Faye's train. See pictures further \ndown for how the skirt could be changed for day/evening looks. Further pictures also show pricing and details of fascinator \nand tie\n <br />\n <br />\n<b>\nSimilar styles from £1200 </b>\n\n</i>",

The main dress is made from duchess satin with a \nstrapless boned bodice and a-line skirt. Delicate lace covers Jenna's shoulders and extends over the bodice to the \nhip. The bodice is finished with a round neckline, stand-up collar and mini-sleeves. The waistline is emphasised with\na simple silver ribbon tied to one side. The a-line skirt (a fairly full a-line) is layered in duchess satin and\ncrystal organza with a simple train at the back. The dress fastens with a zip in the main bodice and is decorated\nwith cover buttons all down the back centre seam to the bottom of the lace. We used the pretty scalloped edging from\nthe lace to finish the sleeves and hip line.\n <br />\n <br />\nJenna had already ordered her dress from overseas but it was a real disaster (see pics further down). So I was\ncommissioned to rescue the dress. The skirt of the dress from China was fine but the bodice was a complete right off.

As you can see it\nis a long way from the design Jenna had in mind. The lace over bodice is very badly shaped and does not even\nlie on her shoulders let alone have the right kind of collar! And at the back it looks even worse. Jenna was also \ndisappointed with the fabric they has used for the 'lace' - being embroidered motifs appliqued onto organza and\nrather cheap looking ones.\n<br />\n<br />\nAll this withstanding, I have seen people who've ordered 'made to measure' dresses from the far east have very good\nexperiences - just not very many. When you send a design (or picture of a designer dress) to a factory over seas to copy\nand pay them 10%-20% of the cost of the same dress bought here, you are inevitably taking a risk. It can go right, but it can\ngo very wrong. You should always expect that the dress will need some size alterations on arrival (I have helped with\nthese many times) as even after sending them your measurements you can't expect perfection with no \nfittings at all. You can also expect the fabric quality to be in line with the price you pay, and the making quality\nto reflect this too.",

The sweetheart strapless\nnecklines were too revealing and needed building up for modesty.

More of the\nsash was then sewn from the underarm up and around the neckline into a pretty halter neck providing more coverage. A ribbon at\ncentre back held the new halter neck in place. Lastly the back wasitline was finished with a ruched satin sash so the line\ndid not break at the side seams but matched all round the dress.\n<br />\n<br />\nThe short sleeved boleros that Ellie's mum made finished the new, more modest\ndresses.",

The main dress is made from pale blue and gold shot taffeta, over layers and layers of tiff netting and a hoop to create the skirt shape. Layers of pale blue and ivory silk tulle are then draped and ruched over the bodice and skirt softening and blending the colours for this fairytale dress. A layer of sequin covered tulle is hidden beneath the top layers of the bodice and top part of the skirt so the sparkles subtly caught the light as Keely moved without being over powering.\n</p>\n<p> The back of the dress fastened with real buttons and loops, hiding a lace up under bodice to really cinch in Keely's waist. The skirt extended in a long train with pretty waterfall bustle detailing. More sequin patterned tulle was used at the train tip, just peeking out from under the silk tulle layers.\n</p>",

The dress was split along the old underbust seam and a ruched satin sash inserted to provide the extra length needed.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe bolero was made with new lace but we chose this kind, 'guipure' as it was very popular in the 1970's when the original dress was created. The bolero was a simple cut away shape with tiny cap sleeves. We used the pretty edging that came with the lace to define the neckline edge of the dress as well as the bolero. The sleeve edges were softened with hand appliquéd pieces of the guipure lace fabric.\n</p>",

    "<p> <i> Official photographs by <a href=\"http://www.linaphotography.com/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\"> Lina Nyberg </a> </i></p><hr /> \n\n<p>\nLaura wanted her dress to be pretty and simple with Celtic/medieval elements. The dress itself was a modern, \nstrapless design with layers of silk chiffon and subtle silver lace with a simple underbust ribbon woven in a Celtic\nknot design. More medieval influence came through on the bolero with long lace-edged sleeves and a swarovski crystal\nfastening across Laura's collarbone.\n\nThe dress was made in five layers of silk: an inner lining in heather purple satin, revealed only when she lifted \nher skirts, then two layers of white satin to help the purple not show through. On top were two layers of white silk \nchiffon, one smooth and one gathered into the high waistline and split at centre front to reveal the layers beneath.\nThe bodice was covered with gathered silver lace and finished with Swarovski crystals. The chiffon hem edges were all\nedged with silver thread, also used around the edges of the bolero.\n</p>\n<p>\n The dress fastened with a concealed zip at centre back but underneath the short-waisted bodice was a hidden lace-up\n corset. This extended all the way to Laura's natural waist and could be laced as tight as was comfortable to provide support and security with her maternal shape\n under the strapless dress.\n</p>",

Luckily the empire-line shape lent itself very well to the emergency alterations \nrequired to make the dress suitable for an 18 week bump. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe top layer of the skirt was already gathered and split at centre front so we knew there'd be no problem with\na bump there. But lower layers had been purposefully cut slim to her figure as all the layers being gathered would \nhave created a lot of bulk- making her look pregnant even when she wasn't! So, to allow for the baby, panels of \nmatching fabrics were sewn into each layer at the side seams, invisible below the unaltered top layer of chiffon. \nThen it was just a waiting game to see if Laura's bust and rib cage would stay small enough to leave the top of the \ndress unaltered. In this case we got away with it but if Laura had needed it let out I had (as always) cut the dress \nwith 3 inches of spare seam allowance in case of last minute weight changes. The innner lacing\ncould of course simply be laced as tight as was comfortable on the day and meant Laura could feel secure in her\nstrapless dress, even with an 18week baby hidden underneath.\n</p>",

It then required \nextensive alteration and restyling to create Miriam's perfect dress. \n <br />\n <br />\nThe dress is made from duchess satin cut in a princess line and with an empire-line seam under the bust. Extremely delicate \nChantilly lace covers the bodice with a scalloped edge along the slightly curved neckline. The dress is fitted to the\nwaist but not boned and then flares into a full skirt over netting with puddle train at the back. More of the lace flows \ndown the skirt dividing at the centre front to reveal the satin with the scalloped edging used to soften the divide.\n The finished dress had short lace sleeves (they were long when we started) the edges of which (and the bodice) were embellished\n with tiny pearl beads. The back of the dress originally closed with buttons and loops, but the elastic of the loops was no\n longer strong enough to hold the dress properly shut once it was fitted tight to Miriam's waist so we added a concealed zip\n over which the buttons fastened with new loops.\n <br />\n <br />\n<b>\nSimilar alteration and restyling work on vintage dresses from £25 per hour\n</b>\n<br />\n<i>The work Miriam had done came to 20 hours</i>\n<br />\n<br />\nI can also make new copies of vintage styles (including this dress) or help you source the \nperfect genuine vintage gown from £100\n<br />\nThis style or similar as a new bespoke dress from £1200\n<br />\n<br />\n<b> Bespoke veils from £50 </b>\n<br />\n<i>\nAs shown, simple two tier veil in ivory tulle, floor length + small train £75\n</i>",

    "<i>\nThe dress before we began...\n</i>\n<br />\n<br />\nIt was a genuine 1950's wedding dress in ivory silk and very delicate lace. The original style differed little \nfrom how we finished. Here are the changes we made...\n<br />\n<br />\n\nThings Miriam had done:\n<br /> <i>\nTo make the dress fit we had to shorten the distance between the natural waistline and the bust at the underbust seam.\n<br />\nIt was taken in on the waist and hip to fit.\n<br />\nThe dress was also too wide for Miriam across the bodice and shoulders.\n<br />\nThe lace over the shoulders and back was mended and strengthened where time had caused it to weaken or perish.\n<br />\nWe Removed and re-set the sleeves for her narrower shoulders, and shortened them to above the elbow.\n<br />\nWe brought the lace above the front neckline down as they were too near Miriam's neck and tended to flop forward a lot. They were also wired to help them keep their shape while worn.\n<br />\nWe shortened the length of the dress at the front for Miriam's height but left the back long to create a puddle train.\n<br />\nA bespoke netting underskirt was created\n<br />\nThe sleeves were shorted and re-finished with scalloped edging.\n<br />\nWe removed all the buttons and loops at the back and added a concealed zip for a more secure fastening. The buttons were then replaced and new loops were added to the back fastening where the original elastic loops had perished. \n</i>",

Together we created the design for this dress all in torn layers \nwith a mix of all the fabrics from my sample books that Angie liked. Angie wanted it wo look like a fairytale \n'attic' dress, cobwebbed and tatty edged but with delicate lace and a bit of sparkle.\n <br />\n <br />\nFitted dress made in palest blue silk satin, fully lined in ivory silk. The dress has a shaped underbust seam \nwith a halter neck bodice and slight collar on neck piece. The boned bodice is covered with beaded blue lace with \nthe scalloped edging used to trim the neckline and underbust seam. The dress then cascades in layers of blue, pink and silver which graduate \nto show off all the different fabrics with uneven torn edges. The skirt layers are made from specially dyed silk \ngeorgette, silk tulle, muslin and delicate silver lace with diamante highlights over gathered netting to create the \nskirt's shape. \n <br />\n <br />\nThe back of the dress laces closed with pink organza-ribbon. Below the lacing a peplum made from beautiful two tone\nblue/gold shot-taffeta graduates into a double waterfall frill.\n <br />\n <br />\nThe same pale blue satin as the bodice has been used for the long gauntlets (gloves). They finish in a \nmedieval-style point over the hand with a loop for your finger. Layers of georgette and tulle cascade from the elbow\nwith torn edges. The gauntlets lace closed over the back of the arm with silver elastic lacing. \n<br />\n <br />\nAngie also commissioned me to decorate her shoes and make her fascinator/bird-cage veil, more details of which can \nbe found with their pictures below.\n\n<br />\n <br />\n<b>\nSimilar styles from £1200\n</b>\n <br />\n<i>\nWith fabrics and detailing as shown (dress+gloves) £1700\n</i>",

Torn layers from the shoulders create fairytale sleeves \nwith tendrils graduated shorter above the arm than below.\n<br />\nThe gauntlets(gloves) are similar to the bride's but shorter and without the silk tulle cascade.\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>\nSimilar styles from £750</b>\n<i>\n<br />\nWith materials and detailing to match bride £1000\n</i>\n<br />\n <br />\n<b>Child Bridesmaid </b>\n<br />\nThe little girl's dress would also have followed on the theme of the other dresses but in a style more suitable for \nher age. The dress is not boned or tightly fitted although you could pull the lacing tight at the back for a closer \nfit if you wanted to. Her bodice has a v-neck and high waistline and the skirt would have all the same layers and \nfabrics to compliment the two grown-ups. A tiny frill of the silk tulle around the shoulders hangs \nlonger underneath. The bodice would be made of pale blue duchess satin with the two-tone taffeta used for the sash. \nMini wrist gauntlets complete the look. \n\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>\nSimilar styles from £300</b>\n<i>\n<br />\nWith materials and detailing to match bride £550\n</i>\n</i>",

The train was also unlined, just shear lace which Ellie\nfelt looked unfinished so she had it lined with satin to match the rest of the dress. As the train was also very long to \nbegin with we were able to shorten\nit and use the extra lace to help re-make and extend the bodice for the new neckline and still have it all match perfectly.\n<br />\n<br />\nRemaking the bodice meant unpicking all the lace and decoration from the original, and removing the boned underlayers. An entirely new \nbodice\nwas then cut, fitted and sewn. This was re-attatched to the original skirt at the wiast seam and covered with the lace and ruched tulle saved\nfrom the old bodice. The zip and \nbuttons were also moved across. Ellie bought the Pronovias dress at least a size to big which meant the skirt was not as tight\na fish-tail on her as it was designed to be. We took it in at the waist and then graduated the shape so it was slim fitting\non the hip and a pretty shape without 'tucking under' the hip or bottom.",

From the sides round to the front the skirt is pleated in softer large pleats\nlike the skirt in the picture above.\n<br />\n<br />\nThe way the skirt hooks up for dancing was designed to look a bit like the 'polonaise' style skirts of the 18th century shown \nhere (centre).\n<br />\n<br />\nThe longer bodice line (the seam is just below Eleanor's waistline not on it) comes from a later \nVictorian period.",

The top layer of the dress is\n ivory silk tulle gathered horizontally across the bust on the bodice allowing the contrasting taffeta(in violet/gold) \n to show through. The tulle extends just a little way above the top of the taffeta onto the skin to soften the top \n edge of the dress. \n<br /> \n<br /> \nFor the skirt the tulle is gathered the other way, vertically, into the underbust seam, the top edge allowed to frill above the green satin ribbon.
