Buttons and loops for Emma Cook
</b>
<br />
  <br />
Emma brought me her beautiful Pronovias wedding dress to be altered to fit as well as have the zip removed and buttons & loops added instead.
We used fabric taken from the hem, to cover the buttons and make the loops to match perfectly.

Buttons and loops made and added from Â£40
