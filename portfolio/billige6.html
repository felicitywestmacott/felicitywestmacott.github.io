Cravats for Amanda Billige's groom and groomsmen

 <br />
  <br />
Modern 'scrunchy tie' style cravats were made for Amanda's wedding party each with a matching hankie. All the cravats were 
made 'pre-tied' with a simple neck-band and clip for ease of dressing. Eight were made in the copper silk dupion to match the 
bridesmaids' dresses and a single one in ivory silk-dupion for the groom.
