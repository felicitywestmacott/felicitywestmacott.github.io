<b>
Fascinator/birdcage veil for Angie Dayman</b>
<br />
 <br />
Angie told me that she wanted something to wear in her hair to complete the 'look'. She wanted a small veil, with beads that 
dangled from its edges and some sort of 'interest' with some sparkle in her hair. So this is what we created...
<br />
 <br />
Silver french veiling in a 'bird-cage' style with swarovski crystal highlights and a seed-bead fringe along the 
edge. The veil pushes into the hair on a comb which is also decorated with lace flowers and twisted wire stamens and
with more crystals in colours to compliment the lace.
