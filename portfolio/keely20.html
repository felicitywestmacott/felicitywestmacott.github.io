 Keely commissioned a dress in layered blue and ivory tulle over shot taffeta with ruched detailing and subtle sequin highlights.

A wrist loop was sewn to the underside of the train to enable Keely to carry all six layers of fabric easily. I added a small piece of appliqué sequin tulle to make it look pretty when carried and a little 'something gold' as we didn't really need a something blue!
