<p>Made in teal shot silk Liz's dress has a boned bodice with ruching to the hip and a wide off the shoulder neckline. The skirt falls in graduated tiers of waterfall frills. Hand appliqu√© of teal lace adds sparkle and texture to the neckline and skirt.</p>

<hr />

<p>Detail of the tiny Swarovski crystals sewn as a scattering along the roll-hems of the waterfall frills that fell from her front hip. I usually sew in a hidden 'something blue', but her Liz's whole dress was already blue I sewed in a red rose for 'love' instead.</p>
