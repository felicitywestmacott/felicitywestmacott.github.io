Hannah was married abroad and wanted a dress that would be light and easy to travel. Her choice of slim style and very light wieght fabrics was ideal for this purpose.

<i>Just thought Id send you a few pics of our big day.the dress was perfect
and Dan absolutely loved it! And it travelled amazingly well considering it
took us a car, plane, coach and boat to get to the venue!
 <br />
And wore it again for our party back in the UK so it did well.!
 <br />
We had a great time so thank you again.
 <br />
All the best!
 <br />
