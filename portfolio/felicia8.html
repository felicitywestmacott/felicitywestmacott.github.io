<b>
My Own Wedding dress

</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by Felicity Westmacott (nee Parks Young) </i>
<br />
 <br />
I went on a shoe making course to make my own shoes. The tutor provided me with a pattern for the shape of the pieces we would cut to make the shoes so I could embroider the cream silk with fushcias before I went. The pattern is not symmetrical but lies across the two shoes in a diagonal curl.
