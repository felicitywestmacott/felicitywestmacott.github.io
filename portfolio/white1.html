Emma bought her dress from a high street bridal shop but came to me for a bespoke bolero to compliment and complete the ensemble.

She chose an ivory lace corded with silver outlines to match the silver detailing on her dress. We used the pretty scalloped edging
that came with the lace to trim the neckline and sleeve edges of Emma's bolero for a soft look.
