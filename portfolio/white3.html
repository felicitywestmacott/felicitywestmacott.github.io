<p>
Emma bought her dress from a high street bridal shop but came to me for a bespoke bolero to compliment and complete the ensemble.

</p>

<p>
Emma brought her wedding dress to the bolero fittings so we could see how they worked together.
</i>
<br />
<br />She also added her wedding
dress alterations to the work I was doing for her. I only take wedding dress alterations, not other kinds. Her dress taken in on
the bodice, the hem was taken up and a hook-up bustle for the train was added. For similar alterations budget about £125, though
ther time needed will differ from dress to dress.
