Laura's wedding dress was styled with medieval touches and to flatter her 18 week pregnant bump.

Laura's dress was nearly complete five months before her wedding (as scheduled) when she discovered a long 
awaited baby was on the way. Luckily the empire-line shape lent itself very well to the emergency alterations 
required to make the dress suitable for an 18 week bump. 
</p>
<p>
The top layer of the skirt was already gathered and split at centre front so we knew there'd be no problem with
a bump there. But lower layers had been purposefully cut slim to her figure as all the layers being gathered would 
have created a lot of bulk- making her look pregnant even when she wasn't! So, to allow for the baby, panels of 
matching fabrics were sewn into each layer at the side seams, invisible below the unaltered top layer of chiffon. 
Then it was just a waiting game to see if Laura's bust and rib cage would stay small enough to leave the top of the 
dress unaltered. In this case we got away with it but if Laura had needed it let out I had (as always) cut the dress 
with 3 inches of spare seam allowance in case of last minute weight changes. The innner lacing
could of course simply be laced as tight as was comfortable on the day and meant Laura could feel secure in her
strapless dress, even with an 18week baby hidden underneath.
