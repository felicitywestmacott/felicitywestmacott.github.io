<p>Edwardian inspired dress made from duchess satin and beaded Guipure lace. The dress is trimmed with gathered lace flounces and groups of pink flowers. Made in three pieces the lace over bodice has long sleeves and a high collar. The train attached with poppas and was trimmed with matching lace flounces. </p>

<p> Although this dress was Edwardian inspired Barbara opted to leave it unboned for comfort. Luckily Barbara has a naturally small waistline which meant the s-curve shape a corset would have created was there anyway.</p>
