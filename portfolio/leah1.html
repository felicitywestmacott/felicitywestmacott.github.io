Wedding dress for Leah Gauthier
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by client </i>
<br />
 <br />

Leah's dress was made from layers of shot silk chiffon in 'dark earth' and 'minky' over a deep brown 
lining. The full circle skirt had one layer of each chiffon with graduated hem lengths to reveal the 
different colours. The soft unboned bodice had a rounded v-neckline and wide shoulder straps. The 
chiffon was ruched into the neckline and across the underbust. A 'scarf' of both colours of chiffon 
came from the  back next to the zip, under the arm and round Leah's neck to tie on one side of her 
bodice. 
 <br />
 <br />
 To keep Leah's dress inside her budget only the skirt and scarf were made of both colours/layers of
 chiffon, the bodice has just the 'mink' chiffon and lining layers. We also kept costs down by keeping
 the more costly silk fabric for outer 'show' only and lined the dress in plain polyester lining fabric.
