Wedding dress for Kelly Thompson
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by client </i>
<br />
 <br />
Kelly and I designed a flowing Grecian style dress in shades of silvery-gold for her spring wedding. 
 <br />
<br />
The dress was made in three main layers, pale gold silk satin beneath two layers of silvery crinkle chiffon.
 Each layer was graduated at the hem to reveal a little of the layer beneath, creating a fluted and fluttery 
 effect as Kelly walked. The skirt was cut full circle from a natural waistline where metallic braid emphasised Kelly's tiny
  waist. The bodice had a deep cross-over v-neckline with straps wide enough to cover Kelly's bra. The wide tie sash detail at the back was cut to hang in water fall folds and also trimmed with the metallic braid.
