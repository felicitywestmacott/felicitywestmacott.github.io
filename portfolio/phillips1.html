Veil for Rachel Phillips
</b>
<br />
 <br />
Rachel bought her dress from Pronovias and had me create a bespoke veil using lace from the train edge (which she had shortened)
to match the dress perfectly.

<b> Bespoke veils from £50 </b>

As shown, single tier veil in ivory tulle, elbow length with beaded lace edge £70
