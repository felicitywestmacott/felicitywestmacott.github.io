Wedding dress for Suzanne Darvall

 Although I made the petal necklace shown above as ordered by Suzanne she had never tried it with the 
 dress. So when her work colleagues contacted me to organise a surprise wedding present I suggested 
 they commission this simple necklace (the string of bronze pearls) as an alternative for Suzanne on her 
 wedding day. This was just in case the petal design turned out to be too much along with the pearl beading
 on the dress. It seems like we got it just right as Suzanne's photos show that she did indeed choose to 
 wear the simple necklace her colleagues bought for her. With our clever planning the simple necklace still
 perfectly matched the earrings and bracelet from the petal set so all was well!
