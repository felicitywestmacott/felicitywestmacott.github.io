Miriam had me source her this beautiful 1950's silk and lace wedding dress. It then required 
extensive alteration and restyling to create Miriam's perfect dress. 
 <br />
 <br />
The dress is made from duchess satin cut in a princess line and with an empire-line seam under the bust. Extremely delicate 
Chantilly lace covers the bodice with a scalloped edge along the slightly curved neckline. The dress is fitted to the
waist but not boned and then flares into a full skirt over netting with puddle train at the back. More of the lace flows 
down the skirt dividing at the centre front to reveal the satin with the scalloped edging used to soften the divide.
 The finished dress had short lace sleeves (they were long when we started) the edges of which (and the bodice) were embellished
 with tiny pearl beads. The back of the dress originally closed with buttons and loops, but the elastic of the loops was no
 longer strong enough to hold the dress properly shut once it was fitted tight to Miriam's waist so we added a concealed zip
 over which the buttons fastened with new loops.
