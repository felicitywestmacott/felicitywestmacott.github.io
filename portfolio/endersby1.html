Lou commissioned a simple Kimono style dress in soft sand coloured silk satin to wear for her wedding day. This dress
worn for a wedding day but was made to an evening dress budget, and so was not lined.

 The dress has a high boat-neckline and is loose fitting but pulled in at the waist by a sash. Three quarter
 length sleeves hang in waterfalls and are integral to the main dress, not sewn on. The neckline, sleeve edges 
 and hem are all bound in wide satin bands to create interest. Lou had a very much loved old dress which she 
 brought to the first consultation and we used it as the basis for her design.
