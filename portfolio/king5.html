<b>
Wedding dress for Elsa King
</b>

<br />
<i>
The original Pronovias dress, before alterations

<br />
<br />
Ellie's church had very particular rules about modesty which were important to Ellie and so the changes we made ensured Ellie
felt both glamorous and respectfully modest on her wedding day.
<br />
<br />
The original dress was strapless and much more fish-tail in skirt shape. The train was also unlined, just shear lace which Ellie
felt looked unfinished so she had it lined with satin to match the rest of the dress. As the train was also very long to 
begin with we were able to shorten
it and use the extra lace to help re-make and extend the bodice for the new neckline and still have it all match perfectly.
<br />
<br />
Remaking the bodice meant unpicking all the lace and decoration from the original, and removing the boned underlayers. An entirely new 
bodice
was then cut, fitted and sewn. This was re-attatched to the original skirt at the wiast seam and covered with the lace and ruched tulle saved
from the old bodice. The zip and 
buttons were also moved across. Ellie bought the Pronovias dress at least a size to big which meant the skirt was not as tight
a fish-tail on her as it was designed to be. We took it in at the waist and then graduated the shape so it was slim fitting
on the hip and a pretty shape without 'tucking under' the hip or bottom.
