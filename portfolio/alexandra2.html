Palest blush satin with ivory organza and tulle layered on top. This commission was lots of fun as the bride is a designer herself and really only wanted me for the labour, all the design was her own! Alexandra also did all the lace and beading work herself, on a spectacular dress that I created for her as a canvas. <br/> <br/>
