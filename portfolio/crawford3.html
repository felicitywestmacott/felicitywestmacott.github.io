Wedding dress for Tracey Crawford
 <br /></b>
<i> Original design sketch </i>
<br />
<br />
Tracey chose the cut away back option with lace up closure as her wedding was planned for June. Although her dress was velvet, being silk it was breathable and with the cut-away back and blousey sleeves she could be comfortable even on a hot day.
