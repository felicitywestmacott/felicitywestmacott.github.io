Wedding dress for Tracey Crawford

Although Tracey was a larger dress size, the design we chose made her look at least three sizes smaller. The bodice supported and flattered her bust while the skirt hugged her curves, showing off all her best points!

<i>Just a quick note to say that Peter and I returned from our honeymoon a
couple of weeks ago after a very lovely wedding ceremony at Langshott
Manor.

<br />
As promised, I attach a few photographs, with particular emphasis on the
gorgeous dress you made me and which drew so many appreciative comments
from freinds and family.
<br />
<br />
I would like to say again how very much I enjoyed the process of designing
a dress with you - from choosing a fabric to discussing design and getting
fitted, it was a joy to watch it all come together.
<br />
<br />
I hope these photos and comments are of use to you on future projects, but
please let me know if you need any further reference, as I would be happy
to supply one.
<br />
<br />
Kind regards
<br />
Tracey Gill (nee Crawford!)
