Issie's dress was made with a boned satin bodice with pretty lace overlay. Long sleeves and a boat neckline were trimmed with a pretty scalloped edging. A simple silk dupion sash highlighted her tiny waist and the back fastened with buttons and loops. The full skirt was three layers of silk organza over linings and netting flowing out behind in a wide train. <br/> <br/> 
 Similar styles from £1850, with silk materials as shown £2700 <br/> <br/> 
 I also made Issie's very two tier long veil. The train part was trimmed in matching lace edging to her dress and the blusher (comes over her face) was edged with simple cording. As shown £175
