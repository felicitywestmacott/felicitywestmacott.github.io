Dear Felicity, Firstly I wanted you to know what a GRANDDDD success the dress was. It was absolutely superb and I still go 
and unzip the cover and have a peek at it. Sooooo many people commented on it. I am so grateful for all the hours you put in!!!!
 You did a incredible job. It was exactlyyy what I wanted so thank you. Only you could have done that job. 
 <br />

 Thanks again. Miss the fittings and coming to see you. Hope all is well with you.
 <br /> Love Ellie.xx
