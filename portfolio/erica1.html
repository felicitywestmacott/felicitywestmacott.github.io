<b>
Embroidery On Erica's Wedding Dress
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by client </i>
<br />
 <br />
Erica bought her dress on the high street and then had it made truly individual with hand embroidered butterflies on the train. 
 <br />
The butterflies were stitched using Japanese silk thread in two shades, white and cream, to just glimmer against the warm ivory of Erica's dress. Each butterfly was individual, with different sizes, wing shapes and subtle wing patterns. Their bodies and antenna were picked out in tiny clear seed beads sewn on with silver thread. <br />
