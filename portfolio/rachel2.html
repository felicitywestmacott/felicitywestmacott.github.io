Rachel commissioned three silk and tulle dresses for her younger bridesmaids and two shop bought dresses were customised for
her grown-up attendants.

Rachel found the simple yellow linen shift dresses an brought them to me for style changes. We added a lace layer, keeping
the feature cut-out neckline and re-binding all the edges in the original yellow trim. The hems were finished with a pretty
scalloped edge for a softer look. I also made the wide wrap around sashes in the same ivory silk as the younger bridesmaids.

I don't take sizing alterations on anything other than wedding dresses but style changes to bought dresses are welcome as
part of a larger dressmaking commission.
