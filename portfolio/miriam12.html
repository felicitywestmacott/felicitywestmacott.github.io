<b>
Wedding dress and veil for Miriam
</b>
<br />

<i>
The underskirt
</i>
<br />
<br />
A removable netting underskirt was created 
to give the skirt some shape. The top panels are stretch-magic, like the tummy control knickers to give a lovely smooth
line when worn beneath a dress, no visible bumps from a waist band - and it holds you in a bit!
