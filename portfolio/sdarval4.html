<b>
Wedding dress for Suzanne Darvall
</b>
 <br />
<i>Design sketches</i>
<br />
 <br />
 Suzanne had seen the plait design on a dress in a perfume advertisement (she brought the torn out page 
 with her to her first consultation) and knew she wanted something 
 similar for her own dress but otherwise had no special preferences for other design details. 
 So I sent her these design sketches showing various different ideas. She choose
 to add the dipped cutaway of the chiffon on the back of the dress and the pearl beading in the 'lace'
  design with matching pearls for the bolero cuff buttons.
