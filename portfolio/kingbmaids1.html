Ellie found bought her bridesmaids dresses from the high street but had the necklines extensively altered to meet the modesty
standards that were important to her. The gorgeous little boleros were actually made by Ellie's mum using silk sourced 
from my fabric books for a perfect colour match.
 <br />
 <br />
 I do not normally take on alterations for anything other than bridal wear but as Ellie was having her own wedding dress made
 I agreed to help with her bridesmaids too. The work done on them wasn't just the usual changes for size anyway but much more
 extensive restyling.
