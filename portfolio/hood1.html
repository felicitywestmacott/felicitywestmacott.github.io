Wedding dress for Kate Hood
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by client </i>
<br />
 <br />
Kate commissioned a soft floaty gown in ivory silk satin and silk
georgette with touches of Nottingham lace.
<br />
 <br />
The dress was made with a simple bias-cut skirt in satin with  
the georgette as an overlay.  Above the high waistline the bodice had 
a sweet heart neckline and gathered georgette straps which widened as 
the went over the shoulder to become the 'wings' at the back. The  
bodice was actually lightly boned but this was completely hidden by  
a soft draped cowl. The lace was used on the bodice peeping out above the cowl on the sweetheart neckline.
