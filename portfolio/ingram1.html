<p>Pretty dresses in ice blue silk dupion with ivory sashes. The boned bodices have sweetheart necklines with a 'ballet pinch'. The knee length skirts are cut full and hang over layers of netting. </p>

<hr />

<p> Two of the dresses were made strapless and the third with straps, as the girls felt best suited them.</p>
