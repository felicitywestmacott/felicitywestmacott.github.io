<p>Made in teal shot silk Liz's dress has a boned bodice with ruching to the hip and a wide off the shoulder neckline. The skirt falls in graduated tiers of waterfall frills. Hand appliqué of teal lace adds sparkle and texture to the neckline and skirt.</p>

<hr />

<p>A lace motif cut and appliquéd to the dress was hand beaded with Swarovski crystals, seed beads and diamanté stones to create a 'brooch' highlight on one hip.</p>
