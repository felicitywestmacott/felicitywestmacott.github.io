 <br />
Tracey wanted a Tudor inspired wedding dress with a modern twist for her wedding  
at the Tudor period <a href="http://www.alexanderhotels.co.uk/langshott/"> Langshott Manor hotel</a>.
 <br />
<br />
The two piece outfit made in deep red silk velvet has a firmly boned bodice cut in  
a 'Tudor' style with a 'flat front'. The wide curving neckline is trimmed with  
ivory ribbon and ivory freshwater pearls, with a slightly turned back collar at  
the sides and back of the neck. Very full sleeves made from ivory silk organza are  
finished with velvet cuffs closing with pearl buttons and loops. The pencil skirt is  
fitted to the knee then flaring to mid-calf and supported by ivory netting.
