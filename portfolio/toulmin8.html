<b>
Bridesmaids dresses and flowergirl for Lisa Toulmin
</b>
 <br />
<i>Modelled by Daisy, Katie and Georgia</i>
<br />
<br />
Lisa's mum had planned to make Daisy's dress herself using a commercial dress pattern but in the end I was asked to take on this
task too. Daisy's dress was made from ivory silk dupion and ivory silk organza with trim made from the same midnight blue silk
dupion as the grown-up's dresses.
