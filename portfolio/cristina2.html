 Cristina commissioned a dress in palest pink silk georgette and satin draped to flatter her tiny waist and full bust.

Cristina has a perfect hourglass figure with a tiny waist but fuller hips and bust so the structure of the bodice was important. We needed to provide support for the bust while keeping the overall look of the dress soft and flowing.
