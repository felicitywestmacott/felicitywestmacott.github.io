<br />
 <br />

Butterfly wing dress with pale green edging and hand beading. 
 
<br /> 
<br /> 
Simple ivory satin dress with sweet heart neckline and halter strap. The bias-cut skirt flows from the underbust line with silk georgette 'wing' panels laid over the top and extending onto the train at the back. 
 <br />
 <br />
The beading was all applied by hand, a mix of Swarovski crystals, natural quartz and turquoise stones, seed beads and sequins. The beading was thickly applied around the neckline, fading away over the bodice and applied in informal scatters on the coloured wing edges.
