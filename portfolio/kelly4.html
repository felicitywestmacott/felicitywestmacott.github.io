Wedding dress restyle (vintage) and bolero for Sarah Kelly <p><b>Similar restyling work from £500</b> <i>(as shown £650)</i><br/><b>Boleros from £130 </b> <i> (with lace as shown £290) </i> </p> <p>Sarah brought me her mother's wedding dress, vintage 1970's in lace with long sleeves to be restyled for a modern bride. I also made her a pretty lace bolero to compliment the fabric of the original gown.</p>
