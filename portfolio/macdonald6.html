<p>
 Jacqueline commissioned a beautiful dress deep green silk dupion with MacDonald Tartan highlights to wear for the 
Ceilidh after her wedding ceremony.  
</p>

<hr />  

<p>
The netting petticoat was made separately so the dress could be worn with or without it. The main dress had just a little tulle
sewn inside so that the skirt stil had some shape even when the petticoat wasn't worn. The pictures at the side show the dress
both ways. 
</p>
<p>The top panel of the petticoat is made of special stretch fabric like 'magic knickers' for a perfectly flat finish with no
bumps from waistbands or pleating showing through the dress.
