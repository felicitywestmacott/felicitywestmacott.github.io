Dress and Jacket for Jan Turner 
</b>
<br />

<br />
Jan commissioned a elegant dress in crushed two-tone blue and later came back to have a matching jacket made.
<br/>
<br />
The dress was a simple princess line shape with v-neckline and short sleeves. The skirt flared out in a graceful a-line shape to 
mid calf. The short jacket has long sleeves and shaped lapels to frame the neckline. It was finished with hand beading
in real hematite chips and tiny black bugle beads.
