 Bow-ties and the back of the cummerbund

blue/gold silk to match her coat, there were two each in old-gold for the best men two in the bridesmaids'
green silk for the ushers and the groom had pale gold organza to match his bride.

Each bow-tie fastened with a hook on re-sizeable neck-band. The cummerbund was lined in silk and 
fastened at the back with a secure clip.
