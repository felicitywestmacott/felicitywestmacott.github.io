</b>

Lou commissioned a simple Kimono style dress in soft sand coloured silk satin to wear for her wedding day. This dress
worn for a wedding day but was made to an evening dress budget, and so was not lined.

Hi Felicity,
My dress was fab, just what I wanted. We had a fantastic day - thank you. I have attached a couple of photos - we didn't have a photographer so they are a couple of snaps taken by some of our lovely friends.
Thank you for all your help. <br />
Thanks
Lou
