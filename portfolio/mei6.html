Wedding dress for Michele Mei
</b>
<br />
 <br />
The bought dress before I began work
 <br />
  <br />
The main dress needed some size alterations for Michele's petite figure before the main work could begin. Then the top of the bodice was 
opened p to allow the chiffon layer to be inserted neatly. Once everything was in place the original scalloped lace edging was 
re-applied to soften the join.
