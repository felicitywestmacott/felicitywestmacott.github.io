Katie Wrote: <i>
I want to thank Felicity for making me the most wonderful wedding dress! I
tried on quite a few ready made ones and had an idea of what I wanted but
nothing was quite right. It was very easy taking my ideas to Felicity who
designed and then made the perfect dress for my special day. I was able to
incorporate my colour scheme (Aqua) and theme (Butterflies) by having the
dress made specifically for me and of course it also meant that it fitted
beautifully. The cost worked out at no more than buying a shop bought one
too!

I had so many compliments on the day itself and am still getting them now
when people see the photos- I would highly recommend using Felicity's
services to anyone who is getting married.... Many thanks, Katie.
