Karen commissioned a beautiful dress in layers of ivory lace and satin. 
</p>
<hr /> 

<p>
The dress has a boned and fitted bodice with sweet heart neckline, where the satin underlayer is just revealed inside the pretty, 
beaded scalloped lace edge. Half-sleeves also made from the beaded lace covered the tops of Karen's arms. The empire-line waist is
 highlighted with a ruched sash in silk dupion which finishes on the natural waistline. The skirt is softly fitted to the top hip 
 before flaring gently in a slight fish-tail. The scalloped edge of the lace is used to trim the hem and the skirt flows out into a
 small train at the back which came with both a wrist loop and hook-up bustle for the evening.
