Similar work from Â£800 <br/> <br/> 
 Madelei brought me her mother's wedding dress which we remodelled. The bodice was made new but with elements of style reminiscent of the original. The skirt was raised at the waistline so it became tea length and the train just touched the floor. Delicate lace purchased from Madelei's native Brazil was added to skirt and bodice and trimmed with tiny daisy motifs.

 Thank you so much for creating my wonderful dress! It collected many compliments and was so me! It brought tears to my MIL's eyes and mum said it was more than perfect! She is so glad we managed to reinvent her dress and will now be passed down generations. The groom was astonished in how it was exactly what he imagined me in. We feel blessed to have found your talent, patience and passion doing this work, and wish success for years to come.
