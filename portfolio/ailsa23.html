explain the different options and the effort you went to in order to make sure it looked perfect, including an 
extremely useful set of instructions for my bridesmaid on how to make the dress look its best on the day.  
Your patience, enthusiasm and skill made the whole process a pleasure!

Thank you so much for  all the work you put into getting the dress just right for Ailsa and the helpful 
advice with accessories etc. She looked lovely on the day and felt very comfortable and happy with the dress. 
The dress fittings became a firm part of the wedding preparations and thank you for your welcome when we visited.
 Ian was especially pleased that he could join us for the final fitting.
With best wishes, Christine
