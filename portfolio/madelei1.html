Similar work from Â£800 <br/> <br/> 
 Madelei brought me her mother's wedding dress which we remodelled. The bodice was made new but with elements of style reminiscent of the original. The skirt was raised at the waistline so it became tea length and the train just touched the floor. Delicate lace purchased from Madelei's native Brazil was added to skirt and bodice and trimmed with tiny daisy motifs.
