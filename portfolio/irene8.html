<i>Shoulder Detail</i>
<br />
<br />
The hand beading at the shoulder was created using Swarovksi crystals, seed-beads and torn strips
of the shot-chiffon. Embedding the beads and chiffon into the ruched shoulder panels created an
opulent and encrusted finish.
<br />
<br />
Guide price for similar beading approx Â£160 per shoulder (front and back)
