Wedding dress for Michele Mei

 <br />
Michele's dress was actually partly shop bought and partly bespoke.She found the simple lace sheath for a good price and then
had me add the chiffon shoulder covering and sleeves to make her perfect dress.
 <br />
  <br />
I used a white silk chiffon and bound the edges with white satin ribbon for the shear look Michele wanted. The back of the
new part fastened above the main dresses zip with a single button and loop.
