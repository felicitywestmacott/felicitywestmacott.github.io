Wedding dress and veil for Miriam

<br />
In the 'olden days' (before the 1970's in the case of this phenomenon) most dresses, 
skirts etc including high end wedding and occasion dresses were not lined as most people wore a slip as a matter of course. 
It does make the inside of vintage clothing look very different from what we'd expect now from a dress that cost a lot of money.
<br />
<br />
Miriam chose not to have the a new lining added, though that can be done for most vintage gowns. Nowadays we don't expect to 
wear dresses with a slip, or to be able to see the 'workings' on the inside.
