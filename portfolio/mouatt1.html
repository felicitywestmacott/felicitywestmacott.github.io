<b>
Mother of The Bride dress and jacket for Karen Mouatt
</b>
<br />
 <br />
Karen wanted to look glamorous and sophisticated for her daughter's wedding day and to show off her new figure, having worked hard
to lose weight.
 <br />
  <br />
Her dress and jacket were both made of cafe coloured silk dupion and lined in pale pink satin which was designed to show
in places. The dress had a shaped v-neckline with looped ruching detail over the bust and ruching all down the slim fitting dress.
The skirt flared from mid thigh into a fishtail shape and the pink satin lining was cut longer to peek out of the hem. Chiffon
sleeves, cut full to the elbow and closing with tiny cover button details finished the dress.
<br />
 <br />
 The jacket was a simple cut away bolero from the front but graduated in length around to the back where a peplum
 detail gave Karen's outfit more glamour, also revealing more of the lining to echo the skirt. 
 The long sleeves and peplum back were both finished with cover buttons.
