Wedding dress for Hannah Loney
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by client </i>
<br />
 <br />

A simple strapless dress with very lightly boned bodice and underbust (empire-line) seam.  The top layer of the dress is
 ivory silk tulle gathered horizontally across the bust on the bodice allowing the contrasting taffeta(in violet/gold) 
 to show through. The tulle extends just a little way above the top of the taffeta onto the skin to soften the top 
 edge of the dress. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
For the skirt the tulle is gathered the other way, vertically, into the underbust seam, the top edge allowed to frill above the green satin ribbon. The underskirt will be made of two layers of ivory silk satin, bias-cut which allows it to be slim-line but flowing and without restricting movement. The skirt is floor length with a puddle train of just the tulle (not the lining silks) and the dress fastens centre back with a concealed zip.

Smilar styles from: £1200

<br />
With silk fabrics and detailing as shown £1350
<br />
 <br />
The fabrics Hannah chose were particularly luxurious and therefore expensive. The silk tulle was £75 per metre! Savings could be made by using cotton (£50p/m) or polyester tulle (£4.50p/m) instead.
