  Ailsa commissioned a dress in blue silk satin designed to flatter her petite figure.

Pictures from toile fitting

<p>
A 'toile' is a practice run of the dress out of cheaper fabrics so adjustments can be made without wasting 
the expensive lace etc. A toile fitting never looks very exciting, indeed I expect a lot of brides go home 
a bit worried afterwards but as you can see from the finished pictures, the final dress looks a lot better!

For Ailsa we played with the placing of the joins between the ruched panels on the bodice by using the pink
ribbons you can see in the picture to find the most flattering lines.
