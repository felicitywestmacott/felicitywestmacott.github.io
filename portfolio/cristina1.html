  Cristina commissioned a dress in palest pink silk georgette and satin draped to flatter her tiny waist and full bust.

The dress has a fitted and boned bodice with round neckline and straps. Draped georgette is ruched in a cross over design across the front bodice and flows into the skirt with waterfalls from the hip. Te skirt is cut as a full circle but hangs straight to the floor in these soft fabrics. The dress fastens with a hidden zip to one side allowing the back bodice to have unbroken ruching across its width. The subtle colour 'blush' of the georgette was perfect for her summer wedding day.
