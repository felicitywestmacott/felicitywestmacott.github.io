Bolero for Carolynne Ball
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by client </i>
<br />
 <br />
Carolynne bought her wedding dress from a bridal shop along with some extra matching silk in order to have a matching bolero made.
 <br />
 <br />
The bolero is made in ivory silk with a shaped collar coming up to the neck at the back and cut away over the front. The sleeves are three quarter length. All the edges are finished with piping for a crisp, clean line.
<br />
 <br />

Guide Price: £280
</b>
 <br />
<i>
Basic making (10 hours) £220 
 <br />
The piped edge takes at least 3 hours, without a piped edge the cost would be less.
<br />
Carolynne sourced her own materials but for something similar budget about £85-£110
