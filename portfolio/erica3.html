<b>
Embroidery On Erica's Wedding Dress
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by client </i>
<br />

One butterfly was made '3D' with ivory silk chiffon wings lifting up from the dress. This butterfly was sewn next to the bustle-loop on the train so that when the skirt was hooked up later in the day the chiffon butterfly was resting just at the top of the bustle.
