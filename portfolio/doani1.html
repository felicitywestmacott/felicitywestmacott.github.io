Wedding dress for Thalia Doani
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by client </i>
<br />
 <br />
Thaila commissioned a simple wedding dress made up in ivory silk satin and georgette. 
 <br />
The dress is cut princess-line with a sweet heart neckline. The softly a-line skirt in georgette extends to a puddle train at the back. The sleeves are unlined and cut with flared ends draping to a 'medieval' point.
