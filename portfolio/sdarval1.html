Wedding dress for Suzanne Darvall
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by client </i>
<br />
 <br />
Suzanne commissioned a pretty dress and bolero made up in taffeta and chiffon. 
 <br />
The knee-length dress has a fitted and boned bodice with gentle sweet-heart shaped neckline and slim straps. 
The dress is made from shot taffeta (shot pink/green/ivory) with chocolate chiffon on top, the chiffon is 
'plaited' down the front of the bodice and opens to reveal the taffeta beneath. 
The neckline has been hand beaded with bronze coloured Swarovski pearls in a 'floral lace' pattern.
 <br />
 <br />
The bolero has long sleeves, gathered at the shoulder and with a button loop closure at the cuff. 
Matching hand beading has been applied all along the bolero edge and the sleeves are finished with 
matching pearls used as the buttons.
