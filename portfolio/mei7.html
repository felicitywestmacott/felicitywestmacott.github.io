Wedding dress for Michele Mei
</b>
<br />
 <br />
Toile fitting

A rough cut of the chiffon parts was made up and a pinned on while Michele wore the dress to asses fit and style. Look closely
and you'll see the pins marking where her final neckline will go. The original dress had come with a very wide and bulky 
duchess satin sash which didn't suit Michele at all so we also experimented with softer ribbons at this fitting to find a sash
style that would suit the dress and Michele's figure.
