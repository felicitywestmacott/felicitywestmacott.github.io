<b>What is a toile?</b>
<br />
After I take your measurements I draft a flat paper pattern for your dress. The pattern is then cut out in a cheap fabric (usually calico) and sewn together for a fitting. Any adjustments needed are pinned on and copied over to the paper pattern ready to be used on the real fabric. The toile stage saves expensive mistakes with your real materials and means you can check the fit and style are perfect in time for a complete change of mind if need be!
