Laura's wedding dress was styled with medieval touches and to flatter her 18 week pregnant bump.

Finished dress, on the stand

 The dress fastened with a concealed zip at centre back but underneath the short-waisted bodice was a hidden lace-up
 corset. This extended all the way to Laura's natural waist and could be laced tight to provide support and security
 under the strapless dress.
