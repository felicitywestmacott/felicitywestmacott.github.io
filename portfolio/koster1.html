Wedding dress for Alison Koster
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by client </i>
<br />
 <br />
Alison's dress was made up in ivory silk dupion and worn with fabulous red shoes! 
 <br />
The bodice was fitted and boned with an off the shoulder neckline. The whole 
bodice was ruched to the hip line with a pretty 'ballet pinch' at centre front. The skirt flared out over layers of 
netting to a 'tea-length' just below the knee.
