Bridesmaids dresses for Lisa Toulmin
</b>
 <br />
<i> Dresses modelled by Georgia and Katie </i>
 <br />
 <br />
Lisa's bridesmaids were dressed in midnight blue silk dupion dresses. The bodices were fitted and lightly boned with wide off the
 shoulder straps designed to provide coverage for supportive bra-straps while still having a wide neckline look (both girls had
  just become mothers). The dresses flared from the natural waistline over netting to give some kick to the skirts. Ruched silk
  sashes finished the dresses perfectly.
