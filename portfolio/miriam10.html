<b>
Wedding dress and veil for Miriam
</b>
<br />

<i>
The dress before we began

<br />
Me standing next to the original dress. Compare the level of my shoulders with those of the dummy (I am 5'4")- 
the lady who wore this dress in 1950's must have been unusually tall. Or it might possibly have never been worn, and was simply
made very long in order that whoever bought the dress could have the length altered to fit.
<br />
<br />
To our advantage though, this did mean that although the dress was originally made with the skirt all one length (no train) when cut to the right 
length for Miriam at the front we were left with a very pretty little puddle train at the back.
