Eleanor commissioned a beautiful dress in palest blue embroidered silk dupion. Eleanor's dress was created 
using a mixture of historical sources as inspiration, Tudor, 18th century and Victorian corsetry
came together to create a dress that flattered her petite but curvy figure. 
 <br />
  <br />
Eleanor's dress has a fitted and boned bodice with a wide off the shoulder neckline. The skirt is sewn 
to the bodice in hundreds of cartridge pleats (see below for detail pics). Worn over a hoop the
skirt is a full bell shape with divided front which reveals the plain silk of the underskirt, edged with a
wide box-pleated frill.
