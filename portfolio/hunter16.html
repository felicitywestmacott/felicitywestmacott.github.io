<p>This dress was made from layers of silk satin, chiffon and delicate beaded lace. Real button and loops closed the back and Emily had sashes in 'sand' and 'royal purple' made to wear for different parts of her day.</p>

<p>Pictures from Emily's fittings show the dress with both colours of sash and with the train spread out and as hooked up for dancing.</p>
