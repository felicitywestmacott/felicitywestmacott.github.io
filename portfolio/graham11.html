  Charlotte commissioned a dress in layered silk satin and Georgette with a dramatic low back filled with beaded lace.

<hr />  


<p>
Creating the lace yoke front and back meant carefully choosing cut so the pattern would lie pleasingly and symmetrically in the dress design. Silk organza dyed to match Charlotte's skin was used behind the lace to support the delicate fabric.
