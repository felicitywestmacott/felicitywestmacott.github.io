Wedding dress for Elsa King

The third fitting

The bodice has been re-made and attached to the altered skirt, only one sleeve is sewn on so far. A practice sash has been 
applied but a better colour silk was found to match the main dress in the end. The train in these pics has been shortened but
not yet lined or re-edged with the scalloped lace.
