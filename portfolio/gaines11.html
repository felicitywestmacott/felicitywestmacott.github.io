<b>What is a toile? </b>
<br />
After I take your measurements I draft a flat paper pattern for your dress. 
The pattern is then cut out in a cheap fabric (usually calico) and sewn together
 for a fitting. Any adjustments needed are pinned on and copied over to the paper
 pattern ready to be used on the real fabric. The toile stage saves expensive 
 mistakes with your real materials and means you can check the fit and style 
 are perfect in time for a complete change of mind if need be!
