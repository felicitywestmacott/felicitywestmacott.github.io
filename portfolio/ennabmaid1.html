Eleanor's five bridesmaids all wore the same style in a mix and matched range of four colours. Rose pink,
pale pink, ivory and gold created a pretty and spring like colour scheme. 
 <br />
 <br />
 The style was a simple knee length dress with flared a-line skirt and straight across neckline. 
 The dresses all had lightly boned bodices with pleated off the shoulder straps and a
 high waistline. The contrast sash was ruched and followed the shaped waistline seam to dip
 lower at the back than the front. The dresses all closed with zips at centre back where the sashes 
 tied in neat bows. Each bridesmaid had a contrast silk stole that matched her sash to wear in the 
 church.
