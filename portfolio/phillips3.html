<b>
Wedding dress for Rachel Phillips
</b>
<br />
 <br />
Rachel bought her dress from Pronovias but it is a style which I could create from scratch. This is my design sketch as taken
from her dress. Please note I do not make copies (it is illegal) but I can create very similar dresses with modifications to 
suit your exact requirements. In this case as we'd have to source lace, which couldn't possibly be exactly the same by chance, 
it would necessarily be different enough to be legal.
 <br />
  <br />
Strapless bone bodice with gathered tulle to empire-line. The dress is cut princess-line below
and fitted to the waist and hip before flaring in a gentle fish-tail shape. Godet panels make the skirt
flare even more, but with subtle softness. The whole dress is cut in several layers of smooth and crinkle
tulle and liberally embellished with lace trim and motifs. The back extends into a small puddle train and fastens 
with buttons and loops above a hidden zip.
