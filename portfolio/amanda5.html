Wedding dress for Amanda Weedon
</b>
 <br />
<i> Toile Fitting </i>
<br />
 <br />
A 'toile' is a practice run of the dress out of cheaper fabrics so adjustments can be made without wasting the  
expensive lace etc. A toile fitting never looks very exciting, indeed I expect a lot of brides go home a bit  
worried afterwards but as you can see from the finished pictures, the final dress looks a lot better! 
<br />
 <br />
In Amanda's case the skirt of the toile was cut from the 'proper' fabric as a cheaper substitute would not have  
hung correctly and any adjustments may not have been the same for the real fabric.
