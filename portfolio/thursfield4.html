Ring Cushion for Fiona Thursfield
</b>
 <br />
Fiona's dress (from Pronovias) came with a lace bolero and she ordered an extra one in order to be able to use the extra lace to decorate various items. Part of the lace was used to make this ring cushion. Ivory silk dupion was found to match her dress and the lace was sewn all round the edge in a wide band with ivory ribbon on a dip in the centre to hold the rings safely in place.
