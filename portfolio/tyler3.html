Original design sketch
</p>
<p>
The bodice detailing evolved from what is drawn here during the making process as Vicki had never been 100% sure about the first idea of ruched chiffon over the bust. Another design element that was left out in the final creation was the underbust trim, which might have been some ribbon, beading or a diamnate trim.
