Prom dress for Cherry Smith 
</b>
<br />
<i> Modelled by client</i>
<br />
  <br />
Cherry sent me pictures of five or six dresses from the internet with styles, colours and details she liked. I interpreted these and drew up some design ideas for Cherry to choose from. The final dress was basically the left hand drawing but with the skirt from number three and also the bolero with long sleeves.
<br />
  <br />
Strapless and boned, princess line dress made from jade satin-back shantung (matt side out) with black tulle over layer. The same satin-back shantung is used shiny side out to make sash with appears to wrap around five or six times before it is tied in a bow in front. The black tulle is cut slightly fuller and hangs a few inches longer than the jade material.
