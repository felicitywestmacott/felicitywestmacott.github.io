The dress had a wrist loop so Thalia could hold the train up easily when she was outside. The same loop was used to 'bustle' the train in the evening for hands free ease of dancing.

The wedding was perfect, and I loved the dress.  It couldn't have been
better made.  Thank you very much for doing such a great job.  You will
definitely hear from me again in the future.

I am thinking of having a
full length coat made around summer time for next winter, so I'll get in
touch around that time.
