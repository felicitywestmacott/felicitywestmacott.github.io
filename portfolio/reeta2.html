<i>Hi Felicity, 
<br />
Everyone was blown away by the dress! I did not want to take it off!!! 
I look at her (the dress) hanging and I want to wear her again! 
Hope you like the pics. I tried choosing pics that would show the dress off as much as possible but the pictures sometimes don't do her justice! 
<br />
She was a dream to wear. :)Thank you so much!!
