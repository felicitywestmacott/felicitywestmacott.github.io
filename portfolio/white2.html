Emma bought her dress from a high street bridal shop but came to me for a bespoke bolero to compliment and complete the ensemble.

Here is a sneaky photo of me wearing my shrug that you made. Everyone commented how lovely it was! You made my idea come true.
</i>
<br /> and later...<i>
I just wanted to say thank you again for the whole experience of having a shrug made for me. It was exactly what I always wanted and went so well with my dress that everyone thought it was just another part to my dress!
I hope life is treating you and your little family well.
<br />
Best wishes, 
Emma
