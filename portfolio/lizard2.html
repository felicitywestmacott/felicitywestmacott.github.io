<b>
Costume For the Tate Britain Gallery
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by Melanie Hemmings</i>
<br />
 <br />
While at University we were commissioned to design and create Venetian-style Carnival costumes for a walking 
exhibition at the Tate Gallery. My costume is the green one with the white face, centre back. I am also modelling a costume made by another student, middle right with the black face mask and red wig.

My costume was based on 'a lizard shedding it's skin'. Other people created designs based on lions, butterflies, birds, among others and inspired by the landscape of Venice, Carmen Miranda or New Orleans costumes.
