Wedding dress for Amy Simpson
</b>
<br />
 <br />
Amy had a very specific brief, she wanted to feel like a Russian ballerina. So the ankle length and layers of tulle were perfect.
 <br />
  <br />
Amy's dress has a fitted and bone bodice with square neckline and straps that narrow to just half an inch at the shoulders. The skirt is made 
from 21 layers of tulle, netting and duchess satin. The bodice and straps are covered in guipure lace with the waist highlighted with
a silk-satin ruched sash. The lace also extends over the skirt in shaped petals that seem to drip down the tulle. All of the lace was hand
embellished with appliqued lace motifs, lace shapes cut from the original lace and beads (glass and pearl). Th back of the dress closed with 
silk covered rouleaux loops and buttons.
