  Lauren's wedding dress was made from matt satin and hand embellished with delicate lace patterns

The dress has a very fitted, princess line bodice, lightly boned and fastening with real buttons and loops at the back. The sweet heart neckline is complimented by a ballet-pinch detail crating a little texture over the bust. The skirt flares from mid thigh in to a fishtail shape. At the back the train is made from over lapping 'petal' panels inspired by Lauren's love of Kate Middleton's wedding dress. This was also the inspiration for the lavish quantities of hand lace embellishment all over the bodice, cascading over the train and edging the skirt all round.
