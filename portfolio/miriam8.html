<b>
Wedding dress and veil for Miriam
</b>
<br />
<i>
The dress before we began...
</i>
<br />
<br />
It was a genuine 1950's wedding dress in ivory silk and very delicate lace. The original style differed little 
from how we finished. Here are the changes we made...
<br />
<br />

Things Miriam had done:
<br /> <i>
To make the dress fit we had to shorten the distance between the natural waistline and the bust at the underbust seam.
<br />
It was taken in on the waist and hip to fit.
<br />
The dress was also too wide for Miriam across the bodice and shoulders.
<br />
The lace over the shoulders and back was mended and strengthened where time had caused it to weaken or perish.
<br />
We Removed and re-set the sleeves for her narrower shoulders, and shortened them to above the elbow.
<br />
We brought the lace above the front neckline down as they were too near Miriam's neck and tended to flop forward a lot. They were also wired to help them keep their shape while worn.
<br />
We shortened the length of the dress at the front for Miriam's height but left the back long to create a puddle train.
<br />
A bespoke netting underskirt was created
<br />
The sleeves were shorted and re-finished with scalloped edging.
<br />
We removed all the buttons and loops at the back and added a concealed zip for a more secure fastening. The buttons were then replaced and new loops were added to the back fastening where the original elastic loops had perished.
