Wedding Dress for Alice Easton 
</b>
<br />
<i>
Detail of the waistline beading
</i>
<br />
<br />
We used Swarovski diamante stones in a mix of shapes including oval, round, square-cut, marquise and drop shape to create Alice's ultra-sparkley detailing.
<br /><br />
This hand beading took 42 hours work (£1050) and used £610 of Swarovski stones
