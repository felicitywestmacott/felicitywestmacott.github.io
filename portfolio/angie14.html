<b>
Bridesmaids dresses for Angie Dayman
</b>
 <br />
<i>Sketches and quotes (never commissioned) </i>
<br />
 <br />
Angie originally wanted to have her adult bridesmaid and little girl in dresses very like her own. In the end budget 
constraints meant Angie made other arrangements for her attendants but these are the design sketches and quotes 
I drew up for her.
<br />
 <br />
<b>Adult Bridesmaid </b>
<br />
The adult bridesmaid's dress would have been made to compliment the bride with the same overall shape, length and 
layering but with more shades of pink, ivory and silver as well as the pale blue. 
This dress has a v-neck boned bodice made from the pale blue satin and is fully lined. The skirt has layers of ivory 
and rose coloured georgette, cotton muslin, and silver lace. Torn layers from the shoulders create fairytale sleeves 
with tendrils graduated shorter above the arm than below.
<br />
The gauntlets(gloves) are similar to the bride's but shorter and without the silk tulle cascade.

<b>Child Bridesmaid </b>
<br />
The little girl's dress would also have followed on the theme of the other dresses but in a style more suitable for 
her age. The dress is not boned or tightly fitted although you could pull the lacing tight at the back for a closer 
fit if you wanted to. Her bodice has a v-neck and high waistline and the skirt would have all the same layers and 
fabrics to compliment the two grown-ups. A tiny frill of the silk tulle around the shoulders hangs 
longer underneath. The bodice would be made of pale blue duchess satin with the two-tone taffeta used for the sash. 
Mini wrist gauntlets complete the look.
