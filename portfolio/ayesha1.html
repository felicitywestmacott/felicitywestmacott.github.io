Stunning dress in winter white duchess satin and bold guipure lace.
<hr/>
Ayesha's bodice had beaded guipure lace hand appliquéd onto a skin colour base. A plunging front neckline is echoed at the back with dipped skirt line to reveal as much back as possible. The lace comes round her shoulder line and arms to frame her neck and head. A stunning pearl button and loop fastening appears to float on her skin. The skirt is cut straight and slim at the front and flares into a dramatic circular train behind. The lace appliqué continues from the bodice onto the skirt and down Ayesha's hips.
