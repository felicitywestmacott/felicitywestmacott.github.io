Bridesmaids for Fiona Thursfield
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by client </i>
<br />
 <br />
A teen dress was commissioned for the 14 year old bridesmaid. The dress was made from the same lilac silk dupion and confetti tulle as the little ones but designed to be a little bit more grown-up to flatter the teenage figure. A fitted bodice with high waist line and narrow straps was embellished with a scalloped confetti edging above a long a-line skirt. A matching bolero was also made.
