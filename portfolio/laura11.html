Laura's wedding dress was styled with medieval touches and to flatter her 18 week pregnant bump.

Laura's dress came with a wrist loop for carrying her train, it could also be bustled up underneath for hands-free 
dancing. All the layers of her dress created a very pretty waterfall effect when the loop was picked up.
