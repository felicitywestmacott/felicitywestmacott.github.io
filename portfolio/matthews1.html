<b>
Occasionwear dress for Marie Matthews (nee Cook)
</b>
 <br />
<i>Modelled by Marie</i>
<br />
 <br />
Marie came back for more after having her wedding dress made in 2009. She commissioned a dress to 
wear to a winter wedding and that would be useful for Christmas parties as well.
 <br />
The slim fitted dress was lightly boned and made in black silk dupion and shot red/black silk chiffon.
The dress had a square neckline with shaped straps which came up over a bust panel of ruched chiffon. 
The chiffon continued round to the back of the dress where it hung in a graceful cowl shape. Beaded
black lace was used to soften the line where the chiffon met the main dress on the underbust.
