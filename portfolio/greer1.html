Bridesmaid dress for Lisa Greer
</b>
<br />
 <br />
Lisa was a bridesmaid for her friend who lives overseas. She was sent the beautiful duck-egg/gold shot
taffeta fabric and given free reign over her own dress design. The other bridesmaid's dress was made up overseas
by a local dressmaker.
 <br />
 <br />
Tea-length dress with v-neck and ruched cross-over bodice. The empire-line waist is trimmed with an inch wide
band of matching fabric and from one side waterfalls of taffeta give interest to the simple a-line skirt.
