Eleanor commissioned the prettiest dress for her child bridesmaid in rose pink silk dupion with an ivory
embroidered organza sash. The dress had a high waistline with full floor-length skirt below. The bodice had a 
square neckline embellished with embroidered flowers and Swarovski crystals and little puff sleeves. 
 <br />
  <br />
Eleanor's page boy had a simple waistcoat made in ivory brocade to match the other groomsmen. A little bow-tie
in blue and gold silk dupion completed his outfit.
