<b>
Mother of the Bride Outfit for Irene Lester
</b>

<br />
Irene had very firm ideas about what she wanted to wear to her daughter's wedding. The dress and
coat ensemble was designed to take her from a cold January daytime to the black-tie evening party
<br />
<br />
The dress was made from old gold silk dupion, lined with silk satin. The boned bodice has a v-neckline
front and back with hand beaded detail over the ruching at the shoulder. The dress was cut 
princess-line with a slim shape fitted down to the hip and then the skirt was a slight a-line. 
Splits from the hem up the seams revealed shot silk chiffon panels to flick out as Irene walked. 
The splits were graduated in height, higher at the back than front with hand beaded detail 
highlighting the top of each one.

The coat was made from thicker silk dupion woven in gold and blue and lined in silk satin. The coat was
also cut princess-line and slim fitting with box pleats at the back to kick out as Irene walked and
echo the dress below. A deep plunge v-neckline revealed a little of the dress beneath while the stand-up
collar was elegant and kept out the cold. The long sleeves were gathered to the shoulder and finished
with wide cuffs in old-gold silk with contrast buttons. The coat fastened with concealed hooks and eyes
with ruched panels drawing the eye to the vintage brooch I sourced to complete the look.
