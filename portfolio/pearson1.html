<p>

The bodice is heavily embellished with lace motifs, beads, sequins and real pearls. Satin flowers are sewn to the sweetheart neckline edge and onto detachable off the shoulder straps which tie to the bodice with ribbons. The dress laces closed at the back over a modesty panel and has a full peplum of box pleats.

<p>
The skirt is very full worn over a hoop, netting and bum-roll to create the early Victorian inspired shape. Large pleats from the waistline help the skirt push away from the body before beginning to hang downward. A large wired water-fall begins on each hip and flows down the side and into the train. A wide panel hand appliquéd with scrolling blue lace edges the hem of the skirt all round and highlights the shape of the waterfall.
