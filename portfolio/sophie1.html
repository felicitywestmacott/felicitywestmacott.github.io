Sophie commissioned a 1950's style dress with with a floaty layered tulle skirt and removable tulle train. A boned bodice supported her bust and emphasised her tiny waist, nipped in by the ruched silk sash. Sheer silk Georgette was gathered at the under-bust line and extended up and over her shoulders. The dress was finished with real buttons and loops at the back.
