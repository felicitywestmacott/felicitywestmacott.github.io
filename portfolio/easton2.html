The dress was created in 6 layers of silk crinkle chiffon over a silk satin base. Netting held out the shape of the skirt.
<br />
Each chiffon layer was cut shorter than the one beneath creating graduated petals on the skirt. The edge of each chiffon layer was finished with a roll hem that made them curl and frill a little to emphasise the layering.
