<b>
My Own Wedding dress (back view)
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by Felicity Westmacott (nee Parks Young) </i>
<br />
 <br />
The back of the bodice fastened with two rows of cover buttons over a hidden lace-up corset. The slightly Victorian feature at the bottom of the bodice is called a 'peplum' with graduated pleats and folds extending a little way over the skirt to create a slight bustle effect. The skirt had a back opening with contrast green silk waterfall and gold silk train embellished with gold lace and hand embroidery.
