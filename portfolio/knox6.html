<br />
<i> modelled by client </i>
<br />

Shirley commissioned a beautiful coat in brown taffeta which was shot through with orange and black for a wonderful autumnal effect suitable for the Winter wedding.

The dress beneath was made in russety-orange silk dupion. The style was fitted with a shaped neckline and small sleeves.
