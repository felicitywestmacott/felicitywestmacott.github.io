<b>
 Child Bridesmaid dresses for Emma Fields
</b>
<br />
  <br />
Emma commissioned me to make two dresses for her nieces to wear as bridesmaids.
<br />
  <br />
The dresses are in a classic modern style. The bodices are made from ivory duchess-satin with a wide boat neckline
 and concealed zip fastening at the back. The skirts are made from three layers, soft ivory tulle on top, 
 supported by a layer of ivory dress net and lined with a plain ivory lining to prevent little girls getting 
 'scratchy' legs. The dresses were finished with coffee coloured sashes in simple satin ribbon.
