When I asked Eleanor how she would like the back of her dress to close, the usual options being zip, 
lace up or buttons she really didn't want any of them. So as I knew I'd be there on the day we decided
to sew her in for a perfect seamless finish. Not an easy job to do but it meant there was nothing
to spoil the line of the bodice at the back. The poor groom had to be given a quick-unpick and
instructions on how to get his new wife out of her dress on the wedding night!
