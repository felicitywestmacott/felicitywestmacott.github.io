Felicity, Just a little note to say thank you for hard work in making my wedding amazing with my beautiful dress :)
<br />
It was exactly as I had imagined and I am so glad I didn't compromise by buying off the peg as you completely captured what I wanted. Thank you as well for the last minute baby-bump alterations!
<br />
Many thank and much love, Laura and Tom xxx
