Isabelle commissioned a beautiful dress in soft layered ivory fabrics. The bodice has a sweet heart neckline and a boned under-bust panel for shape and support. Long sleeves were slim from the shoulder but billowed out before being gathered back into a tight button up cuff at the wrist. The long skirt was cut in a circle. The ivory lace was cut out by hand and appliquéd to the sleeves head and hem, fading with smaller motifs to create a pretty texture and add weight to the floaty fabrics.
