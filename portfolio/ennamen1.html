Eleanor's ushers and the best man hired their frock-coat style suits but had bespoke waistcoats made to order.

Each waistcoat was made in ivory brocade with an oyster coloured satin back. They all had mother of pearl buttons, the traditional waist band at the back and false pocket flaps. 
Each gentleman also had a silk dupion cravat and hankie in colours to match the bridesmaids' dresses.
