Cristina was kind enough to nominate me for a Bridal Industry award. here is what she said in her nomination:
</p> 
<p>She was patient, knowledgeable, & trustworthy. She went out of her way to make the dress design & fittings a relaxed & fun experience. She listened well and completely understood the vision I had for my dress, and made me feel confident & beautiful."
