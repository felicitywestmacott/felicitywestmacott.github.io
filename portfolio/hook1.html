 Gorgeous Ellie was married in Vegas on Halloween and her dress was a wonderful mixture of fifties shape, 
 modern styling and sublte Halloween detail.

The boned bodice and ruched overskirt were made of winter white duchess satin. 
The underskirt is shot black/purple taffeta over layers and layers of white net trimmed with satin ribbons.
