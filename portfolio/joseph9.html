<p>Harriet's sash was made using the matt side of the satin outwards, and covered with the bodice lace on the waistline part. The bow at the back was pre-tied so it would sit perfectly. The back of the dress fastened with a concealed zip and silk covered buttons were sewn on to finish the look. </p>
