Wedding dress for Angie Dayman
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by client </i>
<br />
 <br />
Angie wanted something really different for her wedding: as an older bride she wanted to feel extravagant and  
special without wearing a long white dress. Together we created the design for this dress all in torn layers  
with a mix of all the fabrics from my sample books that Angie liked. Angie wanted it wo look like a fairytale 
'attic' dress, cobwebbed and tatty edged but with delicate lace and a bit of sparkle.
 <br />
 <br />
Fitted dress made in palest blue silk satin, fully lined in ivory silk. The dress has a shaped underbust seam  
with a halter neck bodice and slight collar on neck piece. The boned bodice is covered with beaded blue lace with 
the scalloped edging used to trim the neckline and underbust seam.  The dress then cascades in layers of blue, pink and silver which graduate 
to show off all the different fabrics with uneven torn edges.  The skirt layers are made from specially dyed silk 
georgette, silk tulle, muslin and delicate silver lace with diamante highlights over gathered netting to create the 
skirt's shape. 
 <br />
 <br />
The back of the dress laces closed with pink organza-ribbon. Below the lacing a peplum made from beautiful two tone
blue/gold shot-taffeta graduates into a double waterfall frill.
 <br />
 <br />
The same pale blue satin as the bodice has been used for the long gauntlets (gloves). They finish in a  
medieval-style point over the hand with a loop for your finger. Layers of georgette and tulle cascade from the elbow
with torn edges. The gauntlets lace closed over the back of the arm with silver elastic lacing. 
<br />
 <br />
Angie also commissioned me to decorate her shoes and make her fascinator/bird-cage veil, more details of which can  
be found with their pictures below.
