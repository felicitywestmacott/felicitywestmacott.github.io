<p>This dress was made from layers of silk satin, chiffon and delicate beaded lace. Real button and loops closed the back and Emily had sashes in 'sand' and 'royal purple' made to wear for different parts of her day.</p>

<p>A fitted and boned bodice with beaded Parisian lace. The sweetheart neckline and straps are trimmed with scalloped edging. The lace extends over the full skirt in handkerchief points below a silk satin sash. The skirt is made of floaty silk chiffon divided at the front to reveal the shine of the satin below.</p>
