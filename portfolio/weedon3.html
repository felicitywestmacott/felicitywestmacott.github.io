<b>
Ascot Outfit for Amanda Weedon
</b>
 <br />

<i> Coat triptych, modelled by client </i>
<br />
 <br />
Amanda had her wedding dress made by me and at the same time commissioned an outfit to 
wear to the races that summer. The elegant dress and jacket ensemble would be ideal to wear to any special occasion, from day into evening.
 <br /><br />
The simple dress was made up in pale coffee silk dupion and lined in ivory silk. The dress 
has short sleeves and a gentle square neckline. The empire line waist seam has a 
self-coloured ribbon and neat bow to highlight it. The neckline at the back was a plain 
round neck and it fastened with a concealed zip.
 <br />
 <br />
The coat was made from the same coffee silk, lined in ivory. The cut is 'princess-line' with long sleeves and lapels that reveal the contrast lining.
