will be wearing then again. My dress was fabulous and I really enjoyed wearing it. I felt glamorous 
and elegant in it. I was really quite sad to take it off at the end of the day. Everyone thought that 
we all looked great and the look was topped off by the boys in their matching cravats and hankies. 
Thank you again, Marie and Andy xx</i>
