Martin wanted a coat that would match in with the historical inspired theme of Eleanor's wedding dress.
<br />
<br />
The coat was made from deep blue silk dupion and lined with a gold and blue shot fabric. We used the groomsmens' hired coats
as the basis for his design. The shape is vaguely Victorian, a traditional frock coat style but we did not stick too closely
to period style so that Martin felt comfortable.
