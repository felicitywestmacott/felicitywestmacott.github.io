<b>
My Own Wedding dress
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by Felicity Westmacott (nee Parks Young) </i>
<br />
 <br />
Having worked so much in ivory and white I decided to be bright and colourful on my own wedding day.
 <br />
My dress was in green and gold silk and gold lace. My bridesmaids were in three shades of pink silk with gold embroidered organza on the bodices. The page boys each had gold waistcoats to match my dress and the groom had a subtle pinstriped silk in pale pink, fuchsia and gold for his waistcoat.
