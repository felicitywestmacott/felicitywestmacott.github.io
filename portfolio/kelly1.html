 Sarah brought me her mother's wedding dress, vintage 1970's in lace with long sleeves to be restyled for a modern bride. I also made her a pretty lace bolero to compliment the fabric of the original gown.

<p> Sarah's mother's dress needed to be almost completely remade to fit her taller and fuller figure. The high neckline and sleeves were removed and a new boned innner bodice was created to support and shape Sarah's figure. The dress was split along the old underbust seam and a ruched satin sash inserted to provide the extra length needed.</p><p>The bolero was made with new lace but we chose this kind, 'guipure' as it was very popular in the 1970's when the original dress was created. The bolero was a simple cut away shape with tiny cap sleeves. We used the pretty edging that came with the lace to define the neckline edge of the dress as well as the bolero. The sleeve edges were softened with hand appliquéd pieces of the guipure lace fabric.</p>
