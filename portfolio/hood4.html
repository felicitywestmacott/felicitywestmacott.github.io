<b>
Wedding dress for Kate Hood
</b>
 <br />

<i> pictures taken at the last fitting </i>

<br />
 <br />
These pictures show the detail of the front bodice with lace, cowl, sweetheart neckline and gathered straps.
 <br />
The lace on the back panels was 'faded' into the front cowl by 
using the scalloped edge over the seam.
