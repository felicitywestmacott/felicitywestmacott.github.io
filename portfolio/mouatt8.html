Just as the designs were modified before we began the dress was still changing right up to the last fitting and Karen
changed her mind about the finish at the back of the dress. Originally the dress was to have a silk cowl hanging around a low 
neckline, with an optional chiffon modesty panel which could be poppa-ed in or out depending on the occasion. But after
one fitting Karen decided that simplicity was the key and so the cowl was also made removable, to be poppa-ed back in at the
shoulder if she ever wanted to wear it.
