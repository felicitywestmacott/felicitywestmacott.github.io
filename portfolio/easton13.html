Wedding Dress for Alice Easton 
</b>
<br />
<i>
All finished and ready to go.
</i>
<br />
After her final fitting I steamed Alice's dress to perfection and prepared it to be collected. 
The dress has been stuffed with tissue paper to hold its shape and prevent creasing whilst it travels. 
Alice was also provided with a long, waterproof, gown-bag to protect the dress
