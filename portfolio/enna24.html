<b>
Wedding dress for Eleanor Parks Young
</b>
<br />
<i>
Historical inspiration
</i>
<br />
<br />
The skirt pleats into the bodice in 'cartridge pleats' from the sides round to the back. These are an
 Elizabethan technique, although cartridge pleating can be found used in other fashion periods too, people all throughout history have been inspired by
the fashions of the past. From the sides round to the front the skirt is pleated in softer large pleats
like the skirt in the picture above.
<br />
<br />
The way the skirt hooks up for dancing was designed to look a bit like the 'polonaise' style skirts of the 18th century shown 
here (centre).
<br />
<br />
The longer bodice line (the seam is just below Eleanor's waistline not on it) comes from a later 
Victorian period.
