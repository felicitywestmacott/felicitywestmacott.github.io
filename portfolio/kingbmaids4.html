The satin was ruched to match the underbust sash and then sewn across the neckline to create a higher square neck. More of the
sash was then sewn from the underarm up and around the neckline into a pretty halter neck providing more coverage. A ribbon at
centre back held the new halter neck in place. Lastly the back wasitline was finished with a ruched satin sash so the line
did not break at the side seams but matched all round the dress.

The short sleeved boleros that Ellie's mum made finished the new, more modest
dresses.
