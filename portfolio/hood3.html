<b>
Wedding dress for Kate Hood
</b>
 <br />

<i> modelled by client </i>

<br />
 <br />
At the back the high waistline sloped very steeply down to the small of the back and the lace panel above was kept slim to create a low, open back line. Half inch wide straps held the dress in place while 'wings' of georgette cascaded from the shoulders to beyond the puddle train of the main dress. The edges of each wing were trimmed with the scalloped edge of the same nottingham lace. The dress fastened at centre back with a concealed zip.
 <br />
 <br />
A hook up button was provided for the train in the evening and a ribbon which tied the 'wings' back gracefully as well so Kate could dance without a care!
