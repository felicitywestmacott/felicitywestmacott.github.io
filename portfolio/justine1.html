Wedding dress for Justine Lewis
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by client </i>
<br />
 <br />

Slim fitting dress with boned bodice in duchess satin with silk georgette overlay.  
The bodice has a deep sweet heart neckline and gathered georgette panels from the  
underbust going over the shoulders to create straps. Two gathered georgette pieces  
from a criss-cross feature over the front bodice, echoes with gathered panels on  
the back bodice. The floor length skirt is a gentle fish tail shape with small  
train at the back. 
<br /> 
<br /> 
The really distinctive part of this dress was the 'wings'. Made from georgette flowed  
from just below the shoulders and extended beyond the dress into a  
longer train. The wings were detachable for the evening part of the wedding and  
the dress's train also hooked up for dancing.
