<p>
Lauren's bridesmaids wore the same pale ivory matt satin but cut in a very simple, classic style. Princess line with high boat-necklines skimmed their figures and flowed into simple a-line skirts. At the back all the dresses and tiny puddle trains, edged with the same lace trim as the brides dress. Two of the dresses were finished at the back with buttons and the other two with soft cowls.
