<p>A boned bodice with sweetheart neckline covered with delicate French Chantilly lace . The lace layer has a boat neckline and elbow length sleeves. The a-line skirt is layered satin and silk organza with a small train and slate grey silk-satin sash.</p>

<p> The dress came with a wrist loop so the train can be picked up and carried away from the dust when that is helpful. A hidden 'something blue' was sewn on to peek out when the train is lifted up.</p>
