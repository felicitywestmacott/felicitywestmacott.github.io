</p>Rebecca's dress has a fitted and boned bodice with a face framing collar and v-neckline. Long lace sleeves are finished with scalloped edging. The skirt is a tea length full circle over many layers of ivory netting, each edged with orange satin ribbon. The lace hangs in handkerchief points over the silk skirt and in a waterfall peplum at the back. The dress closes with a concealed zip at the back and is finished with a silk sash and covered buttons on the bodice and back of the halter neck.</p>
