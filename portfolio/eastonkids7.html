Detail of organza butterflies

<br />
The butterflies were each layered with purple and white edged wings and then highlighted with silver 
seed-bead bodies. Their wings were left loose to flutter as the girls moved. They were sewn in
 a flock on each dress to look as though they had just lighted on the girls.

Each butterfly cost £1 to be applied (labour+materials)
