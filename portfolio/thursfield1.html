Bridesmaids for Fiona Thursfield
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by clients </i>
<br />
 <br />
Fiona commissioned two child bridesmaids dresses and one teen dress, all with matching boleros 
 <br />
See next pic for description and guide price for teen dress. Childrens dresses were made with fitted bodices with round necklines and a zip back closure. The youngest girl had a gathered skirt and the middle bridesmaid had an a-line skirt, both to ballet length with netting below. The dresses were made from lilac silk dupion with ivory 'confetti' tulle over the bodice and for the shear sleeves. The sleeves had lilac silk cuffs and a contrast darker mauve/jade silk was used for the sashes and pre-tied bows. Both bridesmaids had a matching lilac silk bolero with three quarter length sleeves and a slightly puffed shoulder to accommodate the puff sleeve beneath.
