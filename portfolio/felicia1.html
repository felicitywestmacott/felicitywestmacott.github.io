<b>
My Own Wedding dress

</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by Felicity Westmacott (nee Parks Young) </i>
<br />
 <br />
Having worked so much in ivory and white I decided to be bright and colourful on my own wedding day.
 <br />
My dress was made with a boned bodice in green silk with a gold lace overlay. The bodice has a pointed waistline, sweetheart neckline, shaped straps and a peplum at the back. The bodice fastened at the back with with two rows of cover buttons and loops. The full skirt was made in gold silk with contrast green silk waterfall at the back and worn over a hoop and netting. I also had a gold lace bolero.
