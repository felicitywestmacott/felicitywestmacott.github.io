<b>
Historical corset and underpinnings for Eleanor Parks Young
</b>
<br />
Two views of the 'bum-roll'
<br />
<br />
A bum roll is worn around the hips to provide support to the skirt above. First worn in the Tudor period they have gone in 
and out of fashion as the fashionable silhouette changed through the centuries.
  
  <br />
<br />
Eleanor's dress design included cartridge pleating at the top of the skirt, another fashion popular in the Tudor and Elizabethan period (and later in the victorian era) and best shown off with the right support underneath -  a bum roll!
