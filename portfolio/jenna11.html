<b>
Wedding dress for Jenna Barker
</b>
<br />

<i>
The overseas disaster!
</i>
<br />
<br />
Here is Jenna in the bodice (unpicked from the skirt) of the dress as it arrived from China. As you can see it
is a long way from the design Jenna had in mind. The lace over bodice is very badly shaped and does not even
lie on her shoulders let alone have the right kind of collar! And at the back it looks even worse. Jenna was also 
disappointed with the fabric they has used for the 'lace' - being embroidered motifs appliqued onto organza and
rather cheap looking ones.
<br />
<br />
All this withstanding, I have seen people who've ordered 'made to measure' dresses from the far east have very good
experiences - just not very many. When you send a design (or picture of a designer dress) to a factory over seas to copy
and pay them 10%-20% of the cost of the same dress bought here, you are inevitably taking a risk. It can go right, but it can
go very wrong. You should always expect that the dress will need some size alterations on arrival (I have helped with
these many times) as even after sending them your measurements you can't expect perfection with no 
fittings at all. You can also expect the fabric quality to be in line with the price you pay, and the making quality
to reflect this too.
