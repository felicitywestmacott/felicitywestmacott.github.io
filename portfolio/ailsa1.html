  Ailsa commissioned a dress in blue silk satin designed to flatter her petite figure.

The dress has a fitted and boned bodice with gentle sweetheart neckline and integral straps. Ruching over the bust 
is balanced above asymmetric draping on the bodice. The skirt hangs straight down from the hip line, flat in front
with soft pleats at each side. The dress fastens at centre back with flat lacing in loops above a flared godet train.
