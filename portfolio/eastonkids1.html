 <br />
Alice commissioned three fairytail dresses for her flower girls.
<br />
<br />
The dresses each had simple bodices in silver silk satin and layered skirts in grey and white 
chiffon over gathered tulle. The skirt layers were cut and graduated in petals with tiny purple 
and white organza butterflies sewn with their wings left to flutter as the girls moved.
The neckline and waistline of each dress was embellished with hand applied Swarovski diamante stones 
to echo the bride's own dress. Shaped necklines and chiffon shoulder frills made the dresses truly unique.
