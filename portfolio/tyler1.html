The dress has and empire line bodice, lightly boned with a sweetheart neckline and shaped straps. The skirt was made of layered satin and Georgette split at centre front to reveal the contrast fabric beneath. A train flowed out at the back and could be hooked up for dancing. The back bodice was cut away and filled with delicate cotton lace, framed by a satin cowl draping from the shoulders. More lace was cut and hand appliquéd to the front bodice and all around the edge of the back opening to blend the join between fabrics.
