  Lauren's wedding dress was made from matt satin and hand embellished with delicate lace patterns 
</p>

<hr />The hand appliqué of lace took 110 hours altogether. The lace was bought as fabric with floral motifs spread across a net ground. This was cut to shape over the dress panels and then every floral motif was delicately hand sewn down before carefully cutting away the 'net' between. Lauren wanted it to look as though the lace pattern was part of the satin fabric. This was the same technique used to apply lace appliqué to the 'Royal' wedding dress in 2011.
