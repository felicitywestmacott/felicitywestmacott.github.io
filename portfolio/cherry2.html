Prom dress for Cherry Smith 
</b>
<br />
<i> Modelled by Client</i>
<br />
  <br />
The back of Cherrys dress was made to lace up with black ribbon over a matching satin-back shantung modesty panel. The sash pieces do not actually wrap all the way around but tuck into the v-shaped opening at the back.

  <br />

The cross-over bolero was made from some lovely black and silver embroidered lace. The scalloped edge was used on the sleeves but the other edges were finished with a wide band of black satin-back shantung. The bolero fastened with hidden hooks and eyes under the front cross-over.
