<b>
Costume For the Tate Britain Gallery
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by Melanie Hemmings</i>
<br />
 <br />
While at University we were commissioned to design and create Venetian-style Carnival costumes for a walking  
exhibition at the Tate Gallery.
 <br />
 <br />
We were given the brief to base our design on two aspects of research: traditional Venetian and exotic carnival  
costumes and also a drawing and sketching session at the natural history museum. My costume was inspired by 'A  
lizard shedding it's skin' and the shape was based on 18th century Venetian costumes.

 <br />
<br />Techniques used to create this costume included:
<br /> <i>hand dying silk to create a 'snake-skin' pattern, 
<br /> creating period undergarments (panniers) to support the 18th century shape of the skirt
<br /> melting plastic and cellophane to create sheer delicate 'lace'
<br /> wiring and starching silk for the mask and shoulder pieces
<br /> lavish embellishment with sequins, lace and stones 
<br /> working with leather for the gloves and lower corset</i>
