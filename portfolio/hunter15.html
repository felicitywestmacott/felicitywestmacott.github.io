<p>This dress was made from layers of silk satin, chiffon and delicate beaded lace. Real button and loops closed the back and Emily had sashes in 'sand' and 'royal purple' made to wear for different parts of her day.</p>

<p>The making process includes a 'toile' or practice run where the dress is made in cheap fabrics to check the fit and design.</p>
