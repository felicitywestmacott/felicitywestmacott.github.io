Simple dress made in pale gold silk satin with an ivory/gold lace top layer. Lightly boned bodice with square 
neckline and high waistline seam with contrast band. Softly draping skirt spreading to a train at the back. 
 <br />
 <br />
Amanda changed her mind four times about the sleeves... I made her some sleeve 'samples' to choose from in the 
end. Just one of each sort (short puff, gypsy, cap and longer puff) and then made the pair up for the one she 
chose. The final sleeve was a gypsy style in wheat coloured silk tulle with a lace edge to match the rest of the 
dress. We also used the silk tulle to make the under bust band to help tie all the elements together.

The lace Amanda chose was £125 per metre and we needed 5m! Choosing a less costly lace would reduce the overall 
cost of this dress considerably.
