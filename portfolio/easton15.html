Wedding Dress for Alice Easton

<i>
 Layers and colours

<br />
<br />
Alice wanted a snow-white dress but was worried that the bright white colour would wash her out so we used the layering of the dress to good effect. The very top layer of chiffon was actually a pale ivory (called 'bleached white) instead of the same 'optic white' as the other layers. You can just about see the difference in these pictures though the effect was very subtle. This meant a slightly warmer tone was nearest to Alice's face while keeping the dress a lovely clean white.
