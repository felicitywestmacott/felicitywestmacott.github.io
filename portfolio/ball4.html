Buttons added to wedding dress for Carolynne Ball
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by client </i>
<br />
 <br />
Carolynne bought her wedding dress from a bridal shop along with some extra matching silk  
in order to have covered buttons added all down the back centre seam. I have a traditional  
button covering machine so every button is perfect, covered in your own choice of fabric. We  
applied the buttons at 2 per inch to Carolynne's dress.

Guide Price: Â£128 or approx 80p per button <i>(labour and materials)</i>
