At such a special time as your wedding you want professional people who you can trust and get along with to be involved in the
 crucial big day elements such as bridesmaid dresses, and Felicity was just that.
<br />
<br />
The dresses exceeded our expectations in terms of quality of the workmanship and they were ready ahead of schedule; if you are planning your own wedding, 'ahead of schedule' is a phrase you'll come to delight in! Felicity was very easy to work with, she always gave good advice whilst having the creative and technical understanding to help create the final product. My bridesmaids were very comfortable and happy in their dresses and I was so pleased with them too, they looked beautiful.

I had such a special wedding day, helped by people such as Felicity. I have already recommended her to friends.

Dear Felicity, very many thanks for producing such beautiful dresses, the girls are really thrilled with them. We will send you
 some photos after the wedding with them all looking glamorous I'm sure. Mind you I mustn't forget the ties.
Anyway thanks again and best wishes, Jean Billige
