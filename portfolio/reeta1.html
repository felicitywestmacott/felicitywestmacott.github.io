  Reeta commissioned a plunge back dress in buttermilk silk satin and ivory lace.

 The bodice is fitted and softly boned with a sweet-heart neckline. The lace extends higher to just below the collar-bone with narrow straps set wide on the shoulders. The back of the dress plunges in a deep v-neck of shear lace. The pretty scalloped edge from the lace will has been used to edge and soften the neckline at front and all down the back. The underbust line is emphasised with a band of exquisite diamante trim, finished by hand at the sides and back to fade away to nothing. The dress was very fitted to the waist and hips before flaring very gently to the floor. The satin under-layer had only a puddle train while the lace will extended longer so there was a wide band of shear lace beyond the satin. The lace hem was also all edged with the same pretty scalloped edging as the neckline.
