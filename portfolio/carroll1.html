Madeleine commissioned a slim fitting wedding dress in ivory lace over duchess satin.  
</p>

<hr />  

<p>
The dress has a fitted and boned bodice with scooped, strapless neckline. The skirt is very fitted over the hips before flaring
into a dramatic fishtail over netting to support the shape. The back of the dress has a low back to echo the front with a
concealed zip to fasten and decorative buttons covered in the same lace and satin as the main dress. The train was cut extra
full for a sumptuous look and the whole hem was edged with a pretty scalloped lace border.
