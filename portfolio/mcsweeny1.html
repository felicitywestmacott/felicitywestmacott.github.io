Party dress for Samantha McSweeney 
</b>
<br />

<i> Modelled by client</i>
<br />
 <br />
Sam had seen a dress worn by Gwyneth Paltrow to a movie premier and together we used this inspiration to
design her perfect 21st birthday dress.
<br />
 <br />
 The fitted and boned dress was made in gold silk dupion, ruched and spangled with Swarovksi crystals.
