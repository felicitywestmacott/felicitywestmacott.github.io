<p>Made in teal shot silk Liz's dress has a boned bodice with ruching to the hip and a wide off the shoulder neckline. The skirt falls in graduated tiers of waterfall frills. Hand appliqu√© of teal lace adds sparkle and texture to the neckline and skirt.</p>

<p> I also made a bow-tie for Liz's groom in silk to match her dress. </p>
