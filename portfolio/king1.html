Ellie found a Pronovias dress in a high street shop with lace and detailing she loved but some elements of the style and particularly
the neckline were far from her perfect dress so an extensive re-styling was required. Pictures of the dress before all the changes are
further down this page.

The finished dress had a fitted and boned bodice with modest round neckline and short sleeves. The dress was fitted to the upper
hip and then flared gently to the floor. The whole dress was covered with ivory corded lace and heavily embellished with sequins
and pearls. A ruched tulle panel gave texture across the bodice and a silk satin sash with vintage style brooch was added as
a finishing touch. The back closed with cover buttons and loops over a concealed zip. The medium length train was edged with
scalloped lace and came with a hook-up bustle for the evening.
