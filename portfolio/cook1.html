Wedding dress for Marie Cook
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by client </i>
<br />
 <br />
Marie commissioned a slim fitting wedding dress in silver coloured silk dupion. 
 <br />
The dress has a fitted and boned bodice and a gentle fishtail skirt that flares at the back into a 
train. The off-the-shoulder neckline is softened with a silk chiffon cowl that hangs loose at the 
back to swing when Marie danced.
