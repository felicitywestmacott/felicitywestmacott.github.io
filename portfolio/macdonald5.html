 Jacqueline commissioned a beautiful dress deep green silk dupion with MacDonald Tartan highlights to wear for the 
Ceilidh after her wedding ceremony.

Finished dress and bolero on the stand
</p>
<p>

The shoulder sash was attached with poppas so it could be worn over just the dress or over the bolero has well. The waist sash
was sewn onto the dress but the bow was also on poppas so it could be optional as we felt it wasn't needed when the shoulder sash
was worn.
