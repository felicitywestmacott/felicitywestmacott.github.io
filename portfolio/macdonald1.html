 Jacqueline commissioned a beautiful dress deep green silk dupion with MacDonald Tartan highlights to wear for the 
Ceilidh after her wedding ceremony.  
</p>

<hr />  



The 1950's style dress has a fitted and boned bodice with v-neckline. The skirt is full over layers of netting to give a real
swish as Jacqueline danced. The stylish little bolero had a lip curving up around the neck and three quarter length sleeves with
pleated cuffs. Tartan silk-dupion was used to make a sash for the skirt with a bow at the back and a shoulder sash that could be
worn with just the dress or over the bolero as well. The bolero had little square
buttons covered in silk Tartan highlighting the back seams and Tartan silk at the cuffs with contrasting green buttons .
