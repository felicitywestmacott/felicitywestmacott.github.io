Simple and elegant dress with lace over-bodice and layered skirt. The main dress is made from duchess satin with a 
strapless boned bodice and a-line skirt. Delicate lace covers Jenna's shoulders and extends over the bodice to the 
hip. The bodice is finished with a round neckline, stand-up collar and mini-sleeves. The waistline is emphasised with
a simple silver ribbon tied to one side. The a-line skirt (a fairly full a-line) is layered in duchess satin and
crystal organza with a simple train at the back. The dress fastens with a zip in the main bodice and is decorated
with cover buttons all down the back centre seam to the bottom of the lace. We used the pretty scalloped edging from
the lace to finish the sleeves and hip line.

Jenna had already ordered her dress from overseas but it was a real disaster (see pics further down). So I was
commissioned to rescue the dress. The skirt of the dress from China was fine but the bodice was a complete right off. I unpicked the skirt from the dress 
and put it to one side to re-attach to the new bodice which I made from scratch.
