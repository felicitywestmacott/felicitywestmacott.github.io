  Vicki commissioned a dress in ivory soft satin and Georgette with a cowl back and hand appliquéd lace.

After her initial consultation but before Vicky booked-in I sent her pictures and a video (which can be seen on my facebook business page) of a quickly sewn sample. Made from scrap fabrics to check I had the right idea. In the beginning Vicky was toying with the idea of an underbust ribbon or beaded line, hence the silver ribbon here.
