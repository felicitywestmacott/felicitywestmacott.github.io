 Charlotte commissioned a dress in layered silk satin and Georgette with a dramatic low back filled with beaded lace.

The dress has a fitted and boned bodice with a sweet heart neckline below a yoke of beaded lace. The back of the main dress plunges low but is filled to the neckline with beaded lace and trimmed with satin covered buttons. The higher boat-neckline of the lace and the armholes are bound in satin. The skirt is fitted over the hips before flaring
into a gentle fishtail with ivory chiffon layered over Champenoise satin. The skirt hem was cut to reveal the layering with the shine of the satin peaking out beneath the matt georgette. The 'reveal' is deeper at the back where the skirt flares into a train, which came with a bustle to be hooked up in the evening.
