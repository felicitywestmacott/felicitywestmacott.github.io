<b>
Gauntlets (gloves) for Angie Dayman</b>
<br />
 <br /> 
Although un-selfconscious and daring as mature brides go Angie did not want to have completely bare arms. So,
to compliment her fantasy-style dress we made these beautiful gloves.
<br />
<br />
We used the same pale blue satin as the bodice with torn silk tulle and georgette in layers cascading from the elbow. 
They finish in a   medieval-style point over the hand with an elastic loop for your finger.  The gauntlets lace 
closed over the  back of the arm in silver elastic lacing, which meant they could simply be slipped on and off with 
no 'doing  up'. And it meant Angie could bend and move her arms unimpeded!
<br />
<br />
Angie's gloves were included in her main dress quote (the £1700 price) but for a separate item they might cost  
as follows:
