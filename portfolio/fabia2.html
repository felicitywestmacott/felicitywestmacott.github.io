<b>Fabia</b>

<br />

Original design sketch for 'Fabia'

<br />
 <br />
Fabia is a strapless dress with asymmetric waistline and ruched skirt. There is scalloped lace detail on the boned bodice, finished with hand sewn Swarovski crystal and seed bead highlights. The same lace detail is also used on the skirt above the wide gathered flounce that flares out at the back to create a stunning train. The ruching on the skirt is 'pulled up' to follow the line from the point of the waist seam and to one side there is a removable corsage of silk roses and lace. The dress closes with covered buttons over a hidden inner corset.
