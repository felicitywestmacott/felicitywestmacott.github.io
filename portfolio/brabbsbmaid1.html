Stunning 1950's style bridesmaids dresses in 'Cadbury' purple with with black sashes and pretty butterfly detail.
<hr/>
The dresses are all simple boned bodices with a 'ballet pinch' detail just below the sweetheart neckline. A halterneck is flattering and provided peace of mind to the wearer. The full circle skirts lie over netting skirts in bright contrast colours of turquoise, green and fuchsia. Black silk sashes emphasise tiny waists with pre-tied bows at the back and concealed zip closure.
