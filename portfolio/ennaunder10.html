Wedding dress for Eleanor Parks Young
</b>
<br />
<i>
Historical inspiration
</i>
<br />
<br />
Eleanor's dress was not an historically accurate representation of any particular period in history
but was designed to look 'historical' in the sense that it did not conform to the common bridal 
trends of 2010. We took inspiration from Elizabethan, 18th century and Victorian fashions to create a
unique dress that flattered Eleanor's figure and style perfectly.
<br />
<br />
The basic corset and wide neckline are early Victorian shapes (1830's). The way the bodice is cut with
 panels that taper from shoulder to pointed front waist are also inspired by period design.
