Faye commissioned an unusual dress in black and red duchess satin. The inspiration for the design came from a dress worn by a 
lady in one of her favourite music videos! Faye's dress was created as a two piece, bodice and skirt but with several
 different ways the skirt and train could be worn to give different looks for the ceremony and into the evening. 
 <br />
  <br />
Faye's dress has a fitted and heavily boned bodice with a sweetheart neckline edged with pleated black tulle and 
beaded lace to soften the line. It laced shut at the back over a contrast colour modesty panel.
The skirt was fitted to her upper hip and then flared in an a-line over netting to the floor. A feature water-fall 'pick-up'
was pinned up to her bodice with a beautiful brooch, connecting the two halves of the design, and revealing the contrast red 
underskirt. The red hip sash was finished with long sash ends at the back that flowed down Faye's train. See pictures further 
down for how the skirt could be changed for day/evening looks. Further pictures also show pricing and details of fascinator 
and tie
