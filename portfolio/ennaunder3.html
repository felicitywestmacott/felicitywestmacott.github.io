<b>

Historical corset and underpinnings for Eleanor Parks Young
</b>
<br />

The corset was made from cotton with metal spiral boning and a lace-up fastening so her waist could be reduced as desired.
<br />
<br />
The hoop skirt is a simple modern shape, with two meal 'hoops' at the hem and a stretch panel at the waist for a perfectly flat finish (no lumpy drawstrings or zips). The bum-roll and net bustle changed the modern shape to the historical silhouette Eleanor wanted.
