<b>
Wedding veil for Aine Elshaw
</b>
<br />
<br />
Aines veil was hand made to match her dress in the same white tulle as the underskirt. 
The simple shoulder length veil has two tiers and was gathered onto a comb for ease of use and security. 
The veil has a tiny subtle silver thread running all around the edge to just catch the light and echo the silver 
on Aine's dress.
