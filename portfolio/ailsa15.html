 Ailsa commissioned a dress in blue silk satin designed to flatter her petite figure.

Detail of the wrist loop provided so Ailsa could pick up her train from the floor when walking. Usually I sew
on a 'something blue' here but as Ailsa's whole dress was her something blue I chose three pretty pastel coloured
ribbon roses instead, to match the floral pattern on her shoes.
