Laura's wedding dress was styled with medieval touches and to flatter her 18 week pregnant bump.

Laura wanted her dress to be pretty and simple with Celtic/medieval elements. The dress itself was a modern, 
strapless design with layers of silk chiffon and subtle silver lace with a simple underbust ribbon woven in a Celtic
knot design. More medieval influence came through on the bolero with long lace-edged sleeves and a swarovski crystal
fastening across Laura's collarbone.

The dress was made in five layers of silk: an inner lining in heather purple satin, revealed only when she lifted 
her skirts, then two layers of white satin to help the purple not show through. On top were two layers of white silk 
chiffon, one smooth and one gathered into the high waistline and split at centre front to reveal the layers beneath.
The bodice was covered with gathered silver lace and finished with Swarovski crystals. The chiffon hem edges were all
edged with silver thread, also used around the edges of the bolero.

 The dress fastened with a concealed zip at centre back but underneath the short-waisted bodice was a hidden lace-up
 corset. This extended all the way to Laura's natural waist and could be laced as tight as was comfortable to provide support and security with her maternal shape
 under the strapless dress.
