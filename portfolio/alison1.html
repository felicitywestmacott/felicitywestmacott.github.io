Wedding dress for Alison Cowell
</b>
 <br />
 <br />
Alison commissioned a soft floaty gown in silk satin and tulle.
 <br />
The dress was cut with simple princess seams and a fitted, lightly boned bodice with invisible zip back closure. 
The dress was made from many layers, two layers of soft ivory silk-tulle, soft ivory satin, an interlining for strength 
and then lined with the same silk satin for a really luxurious finish. All the layers extended to the floor and at the back 
into a foamy, medium length train.
<br /> 
<br /> 
A layer of tulle was gathered over the bust to create texture and define Alison's slenderest point, the under bust line. 
The ruffled tulle extended up past the top of the main dress to create a soft open neckline, off the shoulder and fastening 
with a single covered button at the back. Long fitted sleeves were made of the same soft tulle. The sleeves were also slightly
 ruched and ended with a soft bell shaped opening.

With all silk fabrics and detailing as shown £2300

 <br />
The fabrics Alison chose were particularly luxurious and therefore expensive. The silk tulle was £70 per metre! Savings 
could be made by using cotton tulle (£44) or polyester tulle (£4.50) instead.
