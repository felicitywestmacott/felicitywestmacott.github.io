Getting it on was a mission though - you made it look easy! I will send some pictures as soon as we get them back. I might be in touch again to see if you can transform my dress into something I can wear again and again â€“ it would be such a shame to have it hang up out of sight for the rest of it's life. Best of luck with baby number 2, I hope everything goes well for you. <br/> Love from Issey (and the 'Isabella' dress)
