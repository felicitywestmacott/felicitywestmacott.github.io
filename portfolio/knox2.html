Bridesmaids for Olivia Knox
</b>
 <br />
<i> modelled by clients </i>
<br />
 <br />
Olivia commissioned two child bridesmaids dresses
 <br />
Simple a-line shape with high waist-line made in rich red silk dupion. The dresses were sleeveless with a pretty cowel detail at the neckline. The waist line was high-lighted with an inch-wide velvet ribbon which was sewn into a bow at the back with long tails. The backs closed with concealed zips and then black velvet buttons were sewn all down the back seam.
