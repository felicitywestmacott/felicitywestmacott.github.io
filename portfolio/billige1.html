Bridesmaids for Amanda Billige

Amanda commissioned four bridesmaid dresses and five cravats for her wedding. The princess line dresses had strapless 
sweet-heart necklines with a 'ballet' style gathered piece at centre front. They were made from a copper coloured silk-dupion 
with honey coloured tulle peeping out from the tea-length hem. An invisible zip fastened the back of the dress.
