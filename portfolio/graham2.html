Detail of the back of the dress with the main dress cut away in a curved shape below exquisite ivory lace, specially beaded to order in Italy. Tiny buttons covered in the same champenoise silk satin as the main underlayer of the dress highlight the centre back seam. The dress actually fastens at the side with a concealed zip.
