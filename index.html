        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I have been sewing professionally for more than 15 years,
            specialising in bridalwear since 2003. I graduated from Wimbledon
            College of Art with a BA(Hons) in Costume design.
        </p>
        <p>My family say that I'm never seen without a needle. For
            my work I make beautiful and individual dresses for weddings,
            parties and special occasions, and on holiday I do cross stitch!
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="sectiontext">
        <p>My first memory of sewing is at just over four years old, on
            the floor of my mother's sewing room, making a doll's dress (which I
            still have). I sewed at home for fun, at Brownies for badges, at
            school for GSCE and A-level, fashion shows and for my friends'
            Leavers' Ball dresses. I joined the National Youth Theatre's costume
            dept. and sewed through 6 summer holidays in dusty theatre
            wardrobes and back stage. I sewed my way through art college while
            running a small shop selling clothes and jewellery that I had made myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my early twenties I designed and sewed hundreds of costumes for a
            Yorkshire based Youth theatre 'Livewire'. At university I
            purposefully took the design (not sewing) course and pushed my
            research and design skills - I felt I could already sew! While at
            university I got the bug for bridalwear by working part time for a
            wedding dress shop as their alterations lady. After graduating I
            worked briefly in film and television before concentrating on being
            a bespoke wedding dress maker.
