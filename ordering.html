        <h3>How does my dress get designed and made?</h3>
        <p>
            A free design consultation appointment begins the process where we
            will discuss what you require covering elements such as style,
            materials, the budget and time-scale. A design sketch and cost
            quotation will then be posted or emailed to you for your
            consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
            An individual pattern will be drafted to your
            measurements and series of private fittings will ensure a perfect
            fit and finish. The process of a bespoke bridal dress will usually
            include the making of a toile, which is a mock-up of the design in
            cheaper materials, allowing the maker to perfect the cut and the
            wearer to check the style.
        </p>
        <p>
            All consultations and fittings take place in my own home and so will be
            completely private and you will have my full attention during your
            appointment.
        </p>

        <h3>How long does it take? Can you accommodate rush orders?</h3>
        <p>
            Four to six months notice is usually required though I do get booked up
            for the summer more quickly than the winter months.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have made dresses with less then 3 weeks notice on occasion, please
            ring or email to see if I have space for your rush order.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most wedding dresses take me between 30 and 70 hours of sewing to
            create. Once your deposit is paid your sewing time is booked into my
            schedule and your dress will be made in the time we have reserved
            for you. The actual time-scale is very flexible, we can spread the
            work over many months or begin and finish inside a few weeks.

        <h3>How much will it cost?</h3>
        <p>
            A minimum budget of £1600 per wedding dress slot is required,
            most gowns cost between £1800 and £2600 with fabrics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consultation appointments are free and we can discuss your ideal budget and then
            design with that price in mind. The cost of each commission will
            depend on the amount of work involved and the cost of the materials.
            Design elements that often increase the cost include layering, using lace,
            embellishments and fuller skirted styles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Materials can be bought through me or purchased yourself and can be
            chosen to suit your budget.	Fabrics typically comprise about 1/3 of the total cost.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that <em>all the prices on this website are for guidance only</em>,
            every commission differs depending on the work involved.
            And though some dresses in my portfolio are shown with prices below £1600 I no
            longer take wedding dress
            commissions with total budgets below this threshold.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bridesmaids dresses from the high street will
            always be cheaper than having each dress made bespoke by me,
            I do not compete on price with dresses made in bulk in the Far East!
            But you can be sure of the perfect colour, style and fit for each bridesmaid when you
            choose my services.

        <h3>Do you take alterations?</h3>
        <p>
            I will sometimes take alterations on 'bought' dresses if I have
            space in my schedule. I usually advise that wedding-dress
            alterations are made about 3 weeks before the big day but you can
            visit much earlier for a quote and then reserve time by paying a
            booking deposit.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have altered more than 700 wedding dresses during my sewing life
            and there is very little I cannot manage. If you are unsure whether
            your dress can be altered the way you would like I am happy to offer
            advice and help at a free fitting appointment.
        </p>

            Example costs
        <ul>
            <li>Hems from £25 per layer</li>

        <h3>Do you make copies?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, I can, but no I don't. I would usually be capable of re-creating a
            dress for you but if it is a design that is still available from the
            actual designer it is illegal for me to copy it. I am happy to use
            other people's designs as inspiration and I actually encourage you
            to bring along pictures from magazines or the internet which we can
            use as a basis for designing your dress. It's useful to have some
            idea of the kind of thing you would like.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have made people near copies where the original was nearly right
            but not quite, with changes to the style, detail or colour to create
            the exact dress they wanted . If you really love a dress exactly as
            it is by another designer it's best to buy it from the original
            source.

    <div class="sectiontext">
        <h3>What if I lose or gain weight?</h3>
        <p>
            This should not be a problem. We can reserve your sewing time for a
            period closer to your wedding to allow you to reach your target
            weight before we begin work. If you lose more weight or gain after
            we have started, the dress can be altered to fit as we go along. The
            final fitting would normally be in the last few weeks before the
            wedding anyway to ensure a perfect finish.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Maternity:</b>
            I have also made dresses for expectant mothers and new mothers
            without any problems. We can make plans to measure you and create
            the dress at appropriate points in your pregnancy or after the
            birth. Having worked with such body shapes before I know roughly
            what to expect and will make sure the dress allows for your changing
            shape.
