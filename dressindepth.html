<h1>The design and making process in more detail</h1>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h3>The design process</h3>

<p>
    <b>Initial enquiry:</b>
    <br />
    Your first enquiry could be by e-mail or telephone. You will need
    to
    check my availability for your wedding date and also let me know a
    rough
    outline of what you require. If I have availability and
    think I might
    be able to fulfil your needs we will make a date for
    a design
    consultation.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Design consultation:</b>
    <br />
    The design consultation usually takes place at my home although I
    can also visit you if you prefer, though this is not ideal as
    I cannot bring all the fabric sample books, photo albums and useful bits and pieces with me!
    You should allow a minimum of an hour for your first
    consultation; sometimes it may take even longer!
</p>

<p>
    During the consultation we will discuss what you require and I
    will make
    notes and create quick sketches of ideas.  I will be able to provide a reasonable
    idea of the cost of any ideas we discuss but a firm quote will be
    posted or emailed to you afterwards.
</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3>Fabrics and materials</h3>

<p>

    <img src="{{ site.baseimageref }}graphics/samplebooks.jpg" align="right" />
    I will advise on fabrics and materials at your consultation. I
    have
    sample books with hundreds of colours and types of fabrics to
    which
    we can refer. You can order fabrics through me or I can
    recommend
    suppliers and shops for you to visit. If you decide to
    purchase all
    or part of your materials elsewhere I can provide
    guidance* on
    fabrics, weights and quantities required. I can also
    accompany you on
    a fabric shopping expedition, see the end of this page for more details.
    <br />
    <br />

    If you buy your fabrics from me I will provide samples as soon as
    the fabric arrives from my suppliers. Samples are not given out at
    the design consultation unless specially requested, ordered and paid for (I will have
    to
    order them in for you from my suppliers).
    <br />
    <br />
    I can order extra fabric for you if you need it, perhaps for the
    florist, the invitations or venue decoration. I am happy to sell
    you
    fabric from my sample books even if you decide to have your
    order
    made up elsewhere!
</p>

<br />
<h3>Designing continued...</h3>
<p>
    <img src="{{ site.baseimageref }}graphics/designprocess.jpg" align="right" />
    If we are designing from scratch, any pictures or reference
    material
    you can bring with you to give me the ‘flavour’ of what
    you want is
    immensely helpful. References might be from history,
    bridal
    magazines, films, a picture of your venue, the colours of a
    landscape or anything that has some element of what you require.
    Before creating a new design for my own collections or for a
    costume
    I often put together a ‘mood board’. This is essentially a
    collage of
    images which pulls together all the elements desired
    and conjures up
    an atmosphere to inspire the final design.
</p>

<p>
    Pictures are especially helpful if you (like most people) are not
    sure of
    the technical or design terms for the style or details you
    require. Designing for someone who has no real idea or cannot
    explain what they want is very difficult but not impossible, it
    will
    just take much longer to narrow down the specifics.
</p>

<p>
    Normally all consultations are free but if
    someone seems to be ‘pumping’ me for ideas and drawings without
    committing to a booking I may decline further advice without
    payment. Similarly if a lot of design ‘options’ are requested as
    drawings I may request payment for my time in supplying these.
</p>



<br />


<p>
    <b>Finalising your design and the Quotation:</b>
    <br />
    After your appointment I will provide a line drawing of your
    design with a quotation (by post) for you to approve, with notes
    on any styling or fabrics discussed. This will probably list the
    materials and the making costs separately. Some people get to the
    stage of finalising a design and putting down a deposit at the
    first consultation, for others it takes longer to define exactly
    what is required.
</p>

<p>
    If some details were not decided at the consultation the posted
    design/quote may include ‘options’, for example, different
    sleeves, necklines or fabric choices for you to consider. Some
    parts of the quote may only be an estimate if the exact details
    of a design have not been finalised or the amount of work
    involved (for example lots of embroidery) is not clear.

<h3>Making your Dress:</h3>
<p>
    All consultations and fittings take place in my own home so you will
    be completely private and you will have my full attention during
    your appointment. You are welcome to bring mothers, bridesmaids,
    children etc but please let me know beforehand.
</p>

<p>
    Work is normally carried out with reference to a line drawing that we
    have agreed is the final design. Occasionally the exact details
    of a part of the design may be finalised later in the making
    process; for example the placement of beading detail or the
    length of a hanging sleeve. If you change your mind once work has
    started design alterations can sometimes be made during the
    making process but any extra time or materials needed will be
    charged for.
</p>

    <b>Measuring:</b>
    Every bespoke commission will have a pattern drafted especially
    to fit your figure. The first step is to take your measurements.
    I may also take a few digital photographs of you (clothed) for my
    own reference.
</p>

<p>
    I always prefer to take the measurements myself; this means that
    I can make allowances for the type of figure you have, such as a
    short waist, low bust or rounded shoulders. If I am making items
    for bridesmaids or groomsmen who live too far away to attend a
    measuring appointment I will supply a guide to the measurements I
    require. I will always suggest that an experienced dressmaker
    takes the measurements. You will be asked to sign a disclaimer
    absolving me from any problems arising from inaccurate
    measurements.
</p>

<p>
    Small size alterations are to be expected during a making process and
    I usually leave at least 2 inches of seam allowance inside the
    garment to allow for changes. The hem will similarly be cut long
    to allow for shoe heels. I can take no responsibility for a
    garment fitting if you lose or gain a lot of weight. If you plan
    to diet please inform me early on and we will plan the making
    process accordingly.
</p>

<p>

    <img src="{{ site.baseimageref }}graphics/fitting.jpg" align="right" />
    <b>First Fitting: </b>
    You will need your shoes and the underwear you plan to wear on
    the day as early as possible in the fitting process. This is
    important as the shape of what goes underneath will obviously
    affect the clothes above! You may also be needed to attend early
    fittings for the corsets or petticoats of historical (and
    sometimes contemporary or spectacular) dresses. These foundations
    need to be correct before further work can be carried out.
</p>

<p>
    Usually I will make up a ‘toile’, which is a mock up of the basic
    elements of your dress in cheaper but comparable fabric in order
    to check certain aspects of style and fit before using the final
    materials. A toile is not always necessary and the stage at which
    you first see your dress will vary from design to design. A toile
    can be helpful to prevent costly mistakes; for example, if I am
    working with particularly expensive fabrics, to a complex design
    or if you have more unusual body shape.
</p>

<p>

    <b>Second/third/final fittings</b>
    <br />
    Most commissions will need at least two fittings, and up to four
    or five is normal. Your final fitting will usually be about 10-14
    days before your wedding to allow for any last minute weight
    loss/gain. Earlier or later final fittings can usually be
    accommodated if you let me know at the design consultation.
</p>

<h3>Receiving your finished order</h3>
<p>
    Once your order is finished I will prepare and steam it as
    necessary so it is in perfect condition and ready to wear. You
    may try your garments on when you pick them up but usually you
    will have had a final fitting beforehand so that the order can be
    taken home unworn and ready for the big day. Your dress will be
    ready to transport inside a white, waterproof gown bag on a
    padded hanger.
    <br />
    <br />
    A ‘pencilled in’ picking up date is made at the time you first
    commission your order and a final date and time can be confirmed
    at a later fitting. You may pick your order up as soon as it is
    finished, which could be months before the wedding if an ‘early
    make’ has been scheduled or some people prefer to leave it with
    me until just a few days before the wedding.
    <br />
    <br />
    Most people collect their order in person but I can also send it
    by secure courier. Postal prices with insurance depend on the
    value and weight of your order and on your location. When posted
    your order may need steaming upon arrival.
